I&amp;#39;m nt very enthusiastic about adding this as a code to Address. It sounds like an element on location to me. Or an extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Proposal - element on location&lt;/p&gt;

* Add narrative to the place where the serialization of extensions is described (or the serialization of contained resources), that extensions on the &amp;#39;contained&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;element are&amp;nbsp;not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Update the methodology to make clear that v3-specific terminology (e.g. null flavor) does not appear in the spec except when talking about v3 or CDA mappings. &amp;nbsp;Do a search for nullFlavor and &amp;quot;null flavor&amp;quot; and alter the wording to be non-v3-specific.&lt;/p&gt;

Make it more clear that the REST specification describes the generic mechanism to put tags in the HTTP headers, but clearly point to the Tags on the &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot; page to signal that there are FHIR-specific &amp;quot;FHIR Resource Tags&amp;quot; that make use of this mechanism. The current single link is obviously overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In 1.12.2.0.1, make the label and text use the term &amp;quot;FHIR Resource Tag&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Clearly point from here to the a) HTTP header format for those tags (is there) and b) The entry.category for use in a Feed.&lt;/p&gt;

That symbol (the paragraph symbol) indicates that a field is part of the &amp;quot;summary&amp;quot; version of a Resource. So, this is a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

I can understand this is not evident to the average user, though there is a pop-up text stating this if you hover your mouse over it.&lt;/p&gt;

Ahh. Would an S be better, or even Sum?&lt;/p&gt;

As part of this DSTU, work groups will be expected to align names unless they have good reason. &amp;nbsp;However, in this particular case, we can have a rule (and can even verify it with tooling)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
MnM should declare formal methodology contraint that says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Use &amp;quot;patient&amp;quot; as the name when the only reasonable subject is a Patient resource. &amp;nbsp;Use &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; when other targets are possible (e.g. Specimen which could be Device, Substance, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
May want to handle this as a guideline (warning) rather than a strict rule. &amp;nbsp;E.g. DICOM uses the word &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; when referring to only Patient. &amp;nbsp;However, it *may* be that there&amp;#39;s a domain-specific reason for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

There is not, and never has been, a need to list all content of complex extensions. &amp;nbsp;However, if a profile needs to constrain components of a complex extension (e.g.&amp;nbsp;declare &amp;quot;must support&amp;quot;), then it needs to expand them inside the profile so it can assert such constraints. &amp;nbsp;Profiles can &amp;quot;unroll&amp;quot; both extension and other complex types as deeply as they need to in order to assert their constraints. &amp;nbsp;(The alternative is to reference pre-defined structures that already assert constraints on nested components, but this may not make sense in some circumstances.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is the case with the FamilyHistory example listed. &amp;nbsp;Not only is FamilyHistory.[relationParent] &amp;quot;must support&amp;quot;, but so is FamilyHistory.[relationParent].[type] and [identifier].&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#39;s an issue that &amp;quot;MustSupport&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t visible in the current publication, however this will be addressed under a separate change request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Therefore: no change required.&lt;/p&gt;

Agreed to add guidance on Provenance indicating that it may duplicate portions of information present on other resources and also to give guidance on when to use Provenance for &amp;quot;additional&amp;quot; needed participations that aren&amp;#39;t part of the core resource and when extension is a better approach (and when it might be appropriate to have both).&lt;/p&gt;

Motion: Adopt a single element &amp;quot;strength&amp;quot;, with the following codes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
required: To be&amp;nbsp;conformant, instances of this element must include a code from the specified value set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
extensible: To be&amp;nbsp;conformant, instances of this element must include a code from the specified value set if any of the codes within the value set can apply to the concept being communicated.&amp;nbsp; If the valueset does not cover the concept (based on human review), alternate codings (or, data type allowing, text) may be included instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
preferred: Instances are encouraged, to draw from the specified codes for interoperability purposes but are not required to do so to be considered&amp;nbsp;conformant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
example: Instances are not expected or even encouraged to draw from the specified value set.&amp;nbsp; The value set merely provides examples of the types of concepts intended to be included&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Update the language of the specification throughout. + add an extension for max-valueset (which is impliclty a required binding)&lt;/p&gt;

While we agree the conformance statement should express support for tags, exactly what it means to &amp;amp;amp;quot;support&amp;amp;amp;quot; tags is a much broader question:&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;

&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;
* Can systems actually NOT support tags, and isn&amp;amp;amp;#39;t it dangerous to &amp;amp;amp;quot;drop&amp;amp;amp;quot; tags in this case (Tag like &amp;amp;amp;quot;this is testdata&amp;amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;amp;quot;not to be disclosed further&amp;amp;amp;quot;)&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;

&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;
* Shouldn&amp;amp;amp;#39;t we also specify tag support on documents and messages&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;

&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;
* Is this just a yes/no, or do we need to declare support per-tag (and what would be the right response if we don&amp;amp;amp;#39;t support it).&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;

&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;
* The discussion that has been raised in other groups about tags being &amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;data&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;instead of&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;metadata, and whether something like &amp;amp;amp;quot;required/modifier&amp;amp;amp;quot; tags is necessary has just recently been started, and we better not get ahead of ourselves.&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;

The &amp;amp;quot;proposal&amp;amp;quot; page in the wiki is a workflow mechanism for HL7 and is not necessarily kept up-to-date as names get changed, committees change their minds, etc. &amp;amp;nbsp;If an implementer is interested in seeing what resources are &amp;amp;quot;on the way&amp;amp;quot; they can look at the development page or the daily build page - which we do have links to from the main specification.

Add a &amp;quot;Security Considerations&amp;quot; to the Binary resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Binary resources are not constrained, and therefore can be of any content type and encoding. Therefore extra care needs to be taken to validate the content of the Binary resource against malicious or malformed content.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and include for Binary content that is HTML a reference to &amp;quot;2.12.0.8&lt;a name=&quot;2.12.0.8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Narrative&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and add to the security.html page on narrative the warning on References and other API content being managed on the same domain as user session cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Care should be taken to differentiate HTTP RESTful (API) from browser based server management. Specifically one should separate user session cookies, as an attacker could create content that serves up with content-type &amp;quot;text/html&amp;quot; and has content like&amp;quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;send_to_attacker(document.cookie);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Chained search implementations need to observe the restrictions on a user in the chained search, and that it would be normal to simply omit resources from the search if they aren&amp;#39;t visible, but a server may elect to add an operationOutcome to indicate that additional resources may be available if other access tokens are used (e.g. break the glass)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Alert start and end dates - do all alerts need start and end dates? &amp;nbsp;For example - easy open bottles would not end, vs. those that would need dates e.g. MRSA positive. &amp;nbsp;If the issue resolves, need an end date. &amp;nbsp; The resource has an active and inactive status. &amp;nbsp;The history will always provide dates but more difficult to use. &amp;nbsp;Could put the dates as an extension. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This property may convey specifics about the practice setting where the content was created, often reflecting the clinical specialty. This is an important piece of metadata that providers often rely upon to quickly sort and/or filter out to find specific content.&lt;/p&gt;

The value set for this content is bound by Example because it is a value set decided by community policy. Several examples exist for consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

Propose to try out in DSTU2 the following construct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the following example: Slice path is on &amp;quot;result&amp;quot;, but change the syntax of the discriminator to explicitly mention the reference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Discriminator is &amp;quot;reference.name&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Like this, slicing on the extension on result would be the discriminator value &amp;quot;extension.url&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;result&amp;quot;: [&lt;br /&gt;
{ &amp;quot;extension&amp;quot; : { &amp;quot;url&amp;quot;: http://something },&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;reference&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Observation/123&amp;quot; }, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;-&amp;gt; Cholesterol&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
{&amp;quot;reference&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Observation/124&amp;quot; }, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;-&amp;gt; Trygliceride&lt;br /&gt;
{ &amp;quot;reference&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Observation/126&amp;quot;} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;-&amp;gt; HDLcholesterol&lt;br /&gt;

Will update FHIR methodology to make very explicit that no element (including booleans) have a default and that, if a value for a boolean element must always be known, that element must be minOccurs=1 and have a constraint that makes the @value attribute mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As well, will pass this information out to the committer&amp;#39;s skype chat and FHIR list and will include, as part of a QA, a review of all boolean attributes to ensure there is no implicit assumption of a default value. &amp;nbsp;(And perhaps encourage usage notes on any attribute where an implementer might be tempted to default to note that defaulting is not permitted.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposal to keep UDI as string and add to comment the rationale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Although the UDI is US conceived and administered, it has adoption projects in many countries othe than the USA.&amp;nbsp; Further, UDI is type = string because it is not a simple identifier - it may be an instance identifier, or a code.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Drop value[x].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Add fixed[x] 0..1 as type of * (i.e. can be any simple or complex type), and if a fixed value is specified, then that exact fixed value must be used, with no deviation (ignoring non-significant whitespace, but requiring exact match on string values - i.e. case-sensitive, accent-sensitive, etc.). &amp;nbsp;No additional elements/attributes are permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also add a pattern[x] : *&amp;nbsp;element, with cardinality 0..1. If this is specified, the provided element must conform to the pattern - in other words, each specified&amp;nbsp;element / attribute / property (for JSON) must exist in the instance, but other things may also exist. This is effectively constraint by example. &amp;nbsp;The values of elements present in the pattern must match exactly (case-senstive, accent-sensitive, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Add a constraint that only one of pattern[x] and fixed[x] is permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; We agree that it is sensible to&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;have guidance on how to maintain forward compatibilty without ambiguity on the meaning of the call signature and parameters to be used.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; It seems that -based on previous industry experience- the only safe way to version operations and API&amp;amp;amp;#39;s it to define&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;a new operation with a new name when the signature changes. E.g.&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;someoper2 is the new version of someoper etc.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; Woud this be acceptable to the submitter?&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In most cases this should be backward compatible as we do not expect that users will be utilizing the time component. If they do then this will not be backwards compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

This specification recommends the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/&quot;&gt;W3C Digital Signatures&lt;/a&gt; for signatures. Resources can be signed using the Provenance resource to carry a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#def-SignatureDetached&quot;&gt;detached digital signature&lt;/a&gt;. The Signature datatype is available to carry various Signature types including non-repudiation purposes. Further details on creation and valiation of Signature is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In addition, documents may be signed using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#def-SignatureEnveloped&quot;&gt;enveloped&lt;/a&gt; signature. Specification for Enveloped signature is profiled in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Document_Digital_Signature&quot;&gt;IHE DSG profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Neither of these definitions prohibits the use of other ways of using digital signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

It will become a matrix though, with (param type x datatype). That matrix will hopefully be mostly empty. And we need to decide which combinations are legal (i.e is a token search on an integer element legal?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Add a matrix summary table&lt;/p&gt;

This is a proposal to add &amp;quot;rationale&amp;quot; to ElementDefinition.constraint. I&amp;#39;f not sure quite what the definition of this would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Description of why this constraint is necessary/appropriate. &amp;nbsp;To be used if the reason for the constraint may not be intuitive to all implementers&lt;/p&gt;

Having only a single profile with a unique name/id would be the typical case and having a group of profiles with the same logical name will probably be the exception so the desired navigation can be optimized to jump to a group page only with a group exists and the profile if no group exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;bounds : &lt;/strong&gt;Period 0..1 &amp;nbsp;- outer bounds for start and end of the&amp;nbsp;timing&amp;nbsp;schedule&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;count : &lt;/strong&gt;integer 0..1 - a number of times to do this within the bounds&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;duration : &lt;/strong&gt;decimal 0..1 - how long this thing happens for when it happens&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;durationUnits : &lt;/strong&gt;code 0..1 - UCUM units for duration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;frequency : &lt;/strong&gt;integer 0..1 &amp;nbsp;- number of times to repeat the action within the specified period or period range&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;frequencyMax :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;integer 0..1 &amp;nbsp;- if present, indicates that the frequency is a range - so repeat between&amp;nbsp;[frequency] and [frequencyMax] times within the period or period range&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;period : &lt;/strong&gt;decimal 0..1 - Indicates the duration of time over which repetitions are to occur. &amp;nbsp;E.g. to express &amp;quot;3 times per day&amp;quot;, 3 would be the frequency and &amp;quot;1 day&amp;quot; would be the period&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;periodMax : &lt;/strong&gt;decimal 0..1 - If present, indicates that the period is a range from [period] to [periodMax], allowing expressing concepts such as &amp;quot;do this once every 3-5 days&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;periodUnits : &lt;/strong&gt;code 0..1 - UCUM units for period + periodMax&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;when : &lt;/strong&gt;code 0..1 - a real world event that the occurrence of the event should be tied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will retain &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; as a repeating dateTime (rather than Period - can get the duration from Repeat), but indicate that it is distinct from &amp;quot;repeat&amp;quot; and that both can be present. &amp;nbsp;The &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; represents the explicit scheduling of the information in repeat. &amp;nbsp;At least one of repeat or event should be present (warning - allows for extensions). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will add a number of examples - starting with the ones Gordy provided&lt;/p&gt;

No change. The instance component can reference a presentation state which references the image instances to display. This handles the case of key image notes. The other usecases beyond are not compelling.&amp;nbsp; The expectation is that the originating system will generate such such presentation states as needed for Image access.&lt;/p&gt;

Motion: January 22, 2015; Moved KOD, 2nd CL, Passed 15, 0, 0&lt;/p&gt;

Discussion: Need examples for how the presentation state and references are used in such a case. The client could retrieve the dicom instance to support more advanced features. WADO and QIDO are available for this.&lt;br /&gt;

I know the DAM is a lot more&amp;nbsp;more complex &amp;nbsp;and this limits&amp;nbsp;pointing onlyfrom the child to parent, &amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think would capture the 80% for now and&amp;nbsp;I would prefer to simplify the resource&amp;nbsp;to correct this problem&amp;nbsp;and build it out when actual implementation&amp;nbsp;use cases bubble up and&amp;nbsp;make it clear&amp;nbsp;what we need. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Question: &amp;#39;Does Device include supplies such as dressings, bandages and similar substances&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Base upon the introductory text to Device:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;This resource identifies an instance of a manufactured thing that is used in the provision of healthcare&amp;nbsp;without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a machine, an insert, a computer, an application, etc. This includes durable (reusable) medical equipment as well as disposable equipment used for diagnostic, treatment, and research for healthcare and public health. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Question about Sustance not being a Device is answered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But there is an open question on whether&amp;nbsp;Supply or&amp;nbsp;Device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Certainly a syringe or sponge are disposable manufactured things used for the Dx an Tx could be a Device but still need boundaries between Supply and Device for disposable things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
",3633
"===",3863,"Reason",6,"&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I think that the ensuing &amp;nbsp;discussion&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;boundaries&amp;nbsp;issue&amp;nbsp;stems from an unfortunate choice of &amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;term &amp;quot;substance&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in the original comment:&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;in the original comment:&amp;quot;Does Device include supplies such as dressings, bandages and similar&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;substances&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;the intent was not a substance as in the resource &amp;nbsp;--&amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;things&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;would have been clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I think Device introduction implies that it covers this stuff so the answer is yes. &amp;nbsp; However, the boundary with Supply is less clear especially since the way this stuff is used varies. &amp;nbsp;that question wil be a separate issue waiting for input from Jose who is working on a IHE white paper that touches on this. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Add to support relationship links between goals and between conditions/observations and intervations. &amp;nbsp;This is to be done as an extension for goal relationship types. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reason for the goal, or a measurement of the goal. &amp;nbsp;Can 1) capture an observation and then link to a goal, vs. 2) select a goal and then point to an observation. &amp;nbsp; Which is more typical - both are used in clinical practice. ACTION -- Use #2 -- Goal can be linked to other observations that measure progress to the goal. &amp;nbsp;Establish relationships between goals - predecessor, successor and replacement. &amp;nbsp;These will be done as extension. &amp;nbsp;AND &amp;nbsp;add&amp;nbsp;with current concern pointing to condition -- add observation,&amp;nbsp;procedure request, medication statement, risk assessment, nutrition statement (proposed). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

2) And change&amp;nbsp;the invarient &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;obs-3&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to remove the comparator restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

From the description this appears to be to support&amp;nbsp;a chain of referals rather than multiple independant referals. Is this the case? If so then perhaps rather than altering the cardinality of the referals we should request that PA alter the ReferalRequest resource to add a prior referal element (0..1 Reference(ReferalRequest)) to support the chaining.&lt;/p&gt;

the conformance statement is for a system, not the spec, so I think they need to be broken in the spec. But they&amp;#39;re just wrong at the moment, and they should at least be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

* &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s not idempotent - delete should success if the outcome is that the resource doesn&amp;#39;t exist &lt;/em&gt;=&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the operation is idempotent, if it was deleted, it is still deleted. The fact that another status code is returned does not make the operation any less&amp;nbsp;idempotent, the status of the system remains the same, independent of the returned statuscode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
* &lt;em&gt;what happens when the user isn&amp;#39;t allowed to see the resource?&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; Always return 403, being deleted already does not inflence this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
* &lt;em&gt;what about systems that don&amp;#39;t track deleted resources?&lt;/em&gt; =&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;allow these systems to just return 404&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is better to return the appropriate error codes as specified in the Reason section below, rather than always returning 204.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;* add an invariant that Bundle.entry.status must be missing&lt;/em&gt; if&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bundle.entry.deleted is present&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Agree, add this invariant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;* clarify that a transaction that requests to delete a resource that the server doesn&amp;#39;t (or cannot) know is not an error (and clarifywhat the return value would be&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;gt; This seems to suggest that even deletes which are forbidden make the transaction complete&amp;nbsp;succesfully. &amp;nbsp;It also means&amp;nbsp;that if client A deleted a resource and then client B try to delete the same resource afterwards (using a transaction), client B will think it was responsible for the deletion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Therefore we feel allowing a transaction to complete successfully on these conditions is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

I realize there were actually multiple questions in one here: this ticket is about adding clarification to the search parameter code with regards to case sensitivity (and maybe to token on the search page as well - tokens are not defined to be case sensitive, but I would expect them to be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
search is not case sensitive in general.&lt;/p&gt;

The OperationDefinition allows you to define operations which take tuple parameters which can have parts that are resources. However, the Parameters resource only supports parts that are the FHIR datatypes, not resources. Add Parameters.part.resource (of type Resource 0..1)&lt;/p&gt;

For use cases where richer search capabilities are needed, consider explicitly defining more advanced mechanisms within FHIR (e.g. Query or&amp;nbsp;http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2230)&lt;/p&gt;

Not persuasive - multiple reasons for having mixed languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
- user uses alternative language while recording what patient actually said&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
- source systems in a document cross languages&lt;br /&gt;
- part of an order is for a colleague how speaks a different language&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
- resource in non-english that quotes technical terms and/or display names from an english coding system&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Not persuasive.&amp;nbsp;Conduction and inheritance has proved to be a nightmare for v3. It also makes re-use of data in multiple contexts exceptionally difficult. Conduction and inheritance is nice for modelers but is generally not seen as adventageous by implementers&lt;/p&gt;

Proposed disposition:&amp;nbsp;Common questions can be defined using the DataElement resource. Will add text making it clear that questions can be defined in a re-useable manner in this way. However, doing this is outside thie 80% of how most systems define questionnaires, so questions still need to be able to be defined inline with the Questionnaire&lt;/p&gt;

Revised Disposition: We will go forward with the existing model that went to ballot in January, with the change that the reference to ANY resource is constrained to List.&lt;br /&gt;
Update the description of List.text to make it consistent with its use as section narrative as well as List narrative (i.e. not just a summary of the list content).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When list is included as a section, that text of the list is the authenticated content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

3/5/2015 - Motion to reopen Rick G/Brett M - passed unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Revised Disposition: We will go forward with the existing model that went to ballot in January, with the change that the reference to ANY resource is constrained to List.&lt;br /&gt;
Update the description of List.text to make it consistent with its use as section narrative as well as List narrative (i.e. not just a summary of the list content).&lt;br /&gt;
When list is included as a section, that text of the list is the authenticated content.&lt;br /&gt;
When the section content is naturally narrative only, the reference would still be to a List (not Basic) with an appropriate emptyReason code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Vote: 3/5/2015. Motion: Rgeimer/Bmarquard, Unanimous in Favor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Previous disposition: 1/22/2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Persuasive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Make a modification to section 2.4.1.1 Document Presentation to tighten up the documentation in this section. Tighten the following to a SHALL: &amp;quot;When the document is presented for human consumption, applications must present the collated narrative portions of the following resources in order:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Only the narrative of the child resource represents the authentiucated content of the section. Lloyd and Calvin to wordsmith the actual changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Motion: Adopt the modeling of section as presented by Calvin. See SDWG minutes, Q3, Thursday, Jan 22nd.&lt;br /&gt;
Motion: CBeebe/KConan, Vote F-8, Abs-9,Against-2&lt;/p&gt;

Discussed the fact that names are allowed to vary - where needed to be clear to domain experts, but that there is also an expectation that names will be consistent where there isn&amp;#39;t a pressing domain need for inconsistency and that checking for consistency (across all of FHIR and especially within resource &amp;quot;families&amp;quot;)&amp;nbsp;is part of the QA expectations for DSTU 2.&lt;/p&gt;

The FHIR group feels that they&amp;#39;re still on target to meet their target of 100-150 resources. &amp;nbsp;The larger artifacts are a manifestation of the fact that there are certain &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; constructs that a commonly exchanged and FHIR aligns with these existing patterns (e.g. sections in CDA/CCDA; archetypes in OpenEHR). &amp;nbsp;There are a clear set of criteria used to guide when the creation of a new resource is appropriate and an approval process to help avoid resource proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

Consistency (where appropriate) is a signficant concern with FHIR. &amp;nbsp;The question is what mechanism is used to drive consistency. &amp;nbsp;With v3, the approach was top-down and tooling/model-driven. &amp;nbsp;With FHIR, the approach is more iterative. &amp;nbsp;The risk is being addressed, but via a different mechanism. &amp;nbsp;Certainly mappings will be provided to v3 domain models where there is implementation of them, but the design will not be driven by the v3 modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

Quantity is used in a wide variety of circumstances where &amp;quot;comparitor&amp;quot; is unnecessary. &amp;nbsp;Every place in the financial resources we have a numeric amount, all places in scheduling where there&amp;#39;s an ability to have a quantity or a range, and even within range, it would be wrong/inappropriate to have comparitor present. &amp;nbsp;Primary use-case is Observation.value, which is already a choice of data types. &amp;nbsp;Agree that using Range for this would be incorrect, but agree to introduce a new data type for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

We have existing guidance around the use of &amp;quot;isModifier&amp;quot; as well as rules that require complete &amp;quot;coverage&amp;quot; of the semantic space for &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; attributes. &amp;nbsp;However, we will re-iterate these to the work groups specifically with respect to status and will call out &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; as something worth consideration. &amp;nbsp;However, we feel that &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; is something to be considered domain by domain. &amp;nbsp;For example, with Account, entered in error is subsumed under &amp;quot;inactive&amp;quot; for business purposes and calling it out as a distinct code may be inappropriate, while for Alert, the notion of &amp;quot;this was once the case&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;this was never the case&amp;quot; could be an important distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

See resolution to #5171 about the use of &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;However, we need to define when &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; needs to exist and when it is sufficient/appropriate to simply &amp;quot;delete&amp;quot; the record. &amp;nbsp;Will consult with the work groups using &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; to determine what their rationales for it is and, once a common pattern is identified, will propagate that pattern on for other resources to follow. &amp;nbsp;Will also add guidance in the specification that explains the difference between &amp;quot;deleting&amp;quot; and flagging something as &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; that resources using &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; can point to. &amp;nbsp;Also need to provide very clear explanation of what &amp;quot;entered in error&amp;quot; means. &amp;nbsp;I.e. &amp;quot;This fact about the patient/subject was never true. &amp;nbsp;E.g. wrong patient in the record, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

This clinical trial opt-in example, in contrast to the first example in this section (&amp;quot;Chief Red Cloud&amp;quot;) contains no element. The reason for this difference is not explained, so I am unsure whether it is significant or not: can an extension defining complex content have text for each of its fields? Also, &amp;quot;Chief Red Cloud&amp;quot; in the first example is confusing because it is outside the definition, and perhaps it has nothing at all to do with extensions?&lt;/p&gt;

This is a rather lengthy description of System Profiles, that would fit better under 6.17 Profiles resource. The Conformance resource could briefly discuss System Profiles as they relate to conformance (as it does for 6.16.4.1.1 Resource Profiles), but could otherwise just link to the Profiles resource for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

Provenance is sufficient for signatures accross one or more resources. The signature element in Provenance is now a 0..*, and has exposed some of the signature elements. One of these elements exposed is the purpose for the signature (aka the role the signer played when the signature occured). This allows one to search for signatures of a specific type. Together this provides the solution requested.&lt;/p&gt;

Proposal is to add a SecurityEvent.participant.policy, 0..*, as a URI type. Where the URI points at the specific policy(s) that authorized the event being recorded. See current use in Provenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example: Where an OAuth token authorizes, the unique identifier from the OAuth token is placed in to the policy field. Where a policy engine (e.g. XACML) holds policy logic, the unique policy identifier is placed into the policy field.&lt;/p&gt;

Will add &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; to the Identifier type as 0..1 CodeableConcept. &amp;nbsp;Binding as &amp;quot;extensible&amp;quot; (must use one of the approved codes if one applies - for interoperability, can supplement with local translations or with additional codes if none of the HL7 codes applies). &amp;nbsp;Will add usage notes that the code is not a substitute for &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; and that codes should not be defined that are 1..1 with system. &amp;nbsp;Will add the above guidance on what codes will be accepted into the HL7-maintained value set as part of the definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;A role class played by a person who receives benefit coverage under the terms of a particular insurance policy. The underwriter of that policy is the scoping entity. The covered party receives coverage because of some contractual or other relationship with the holder of that policy.&lt;br /&gt;
Discussion: This reason for coverage is captured in &amp;#39;Role.code&amp;#39; and a relationship link with type code of indirect authority should be included using the policy holder role as the source, and the covered party role as the target.&lt;br /&gt;
Note that a particular policy may cover several individuals one of whom may be, but need not be, the policy holder. Thus the notion of covered party is a role that is distinct from that of the policy holder.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;An entity to be contacted in the event of an emergency&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;display value=&amp;quot;dependent&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;: A role played by a person covered under a policy or program based on an association with a subscriber, which is recognized by the policy holder.&lt;br /&gt;
Note: The party playing the role of a dependent is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClass CoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a dependent may make a claim under a policy, e.g., a dependent under a health insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy for wellness examines or if injured and there is no liable third party. In the case of a dependent making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that the dependent has filed a claim for services covered under the health insurance policy.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: The dependent has an association with the subscriber such as a financial dependency or personal relationship such as that of a spouse, or a natural or adopted child. The policy holder may be required by law to recognize certain associations or may have discretion about the associations. For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents. Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriber&amp;rsquo;s legal standing in the relationship with the dependent&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;The role played by a person acting as the estate executor for a deceased subscriber or policyholder who was the responsible party.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;display value=&amp;quot;grantee&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;Who/what has been delegated a specific right. For example, in the case of substance abuse related information, under certain conditions the authority to grant, withhold, or withdraw consent to the disclosure of the information, is granted to the client.&amp;nbsp; In another example, a Clearinghouse may act an agent/proxy for a provider organization as an intermediary and therefore can be a grantee as well.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/concept&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;The specific kinds of roles that issue information privacy grants that permit or prohibit potential actions on information artifacts. Examples: Patient, Parent, Legal Guardian, and Health Information Exchange.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;An entity that is the subject of an investigation. This role is scoped by the party responsible for the investigation.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;display value=&amp;quot;named insured&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;definition value=&amp;quot;A role played by a party to an insurance policy to which the insurer agrees to indemnify for losses, provides benefits for, or renders services. A named insured may be either a person, non-person living subject, or an organization, or a group of persons, non-person living subjects, or organizations.&lt;br /&gt;
Discussion: The coded concept NAMED should not be used where a more specific child concept in this Specializable value set applies. In some cases, the named insured may not be the policy holder, e.g., where a policy holder purchases life insurance policy in which another party is the named insured and the policy holder is the beneficiary of the policy.&lt;br /&gt;
Note: The party playing the role of a named insured is not a claimant in the sense conveyed by the RoleClassCoveredParty CLAIM (claimant). However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., e.g., a party that is the named insured and policy holder under a comprehensive automobile insurance policy may become the claimant for coverage under that policy e.g., if injured in an automobile accident and there is no liable third party. In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that a named insured has filed a claim for a loss.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: The named insured under a comprehensive automobile, disability, or property and casualty policy that is the named insured and may or may not be the policy holder.&lt;br /&gt;

Replace the introduction paragraph on Provenance Resource&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g., Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact Security, Privacy, and Trust policies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Care Plans can be conveyed using documents, but in FHIR they need to be able to be conveyed using other paradigms too (REST, messaging, etc.). &amp;nbsp;The levels and types of complexity of care plans are many and exist on&amp;nbsp;a continuum. &amp;nbsp;Even complex care plans need to be understood by &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; systems and vice versa. &amp;nbsp;A single resource with varying profiles is the cleanest mechanism to ensure this. &amp;nbsp;Patient Care would be happy to consider working with the balloter to define 2 or more profiles on CarePlan to reflect examples of the different levels of complexity that care plans might have.&lt;/p&gt;

This resource shouldn&amp;#39;t be under Financial and should have no financial-specific language (e.g. Insurer). &amp;nbsp;Instead, this is an infrastructure resource intended to support &amp;quot;polling&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Suggest this go to ITS&amp;nbsp;to come up with a generic mechanism to support polling and how that will work across all transmission paradigms (REST, Messaging, Services). &amp;nbsp;This should align with mechanisms for querying, publish subscribe, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As part of this, revisit which elements are part of the 80% for polling and which should be included as standard extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; There are guidelines and a QA process in place to ensure consistency of resources (and where such consistency is necessary). &amp;amp;nbsp;For profiles, there&amp;amp;#39;s an expectation that all profiles on a given resources are reviewed by the work group responsible for that resoruce, which provides an opportunity for consistency checking. &amp;amp;nbsp;We will update the methodology to note that part of the work groups&amp;amp;#39; mandate is to check for &amp;amp;quot;appropriate&amp;amp;quot; consistency. &amp;amp;nbsp;However, given that profiles may cover very different use-cases, it&amp;amp;#39;s entirely possible that consistency will not be possible or even desireable. &amp;amp;nbsp;For example, DAF is focused on very simple data exchange. &amp;amp;nbsp;USLab is much more complex in terms of requirements/scope.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; 2015-01-19 MnM Q2 Isaac/Jeff 16-0-0&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most clinical (and many administrative and infrastructure) resources SHOULD have an element that conveys free-text comments and additional information. &amp;nbsp;The preferred name for this element is &amp;quot;note&amp;quot; (following our convention for singluar names). &amp;nbsp;Work groups should consider renaming existing elements that serve this purpose unless domain conventions dictate otherwise. &amp;nbsp;The definition should give examples of the type of information that might typically be conveyed here. &amp;nbsp;These elements SHOULD be flagged as isModifier due to the possibility that information here could impact interpretation of other elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will add a note in the Narrative portion of the specification explaining the reason for free-text eleements such as *.note - namely their utility in allowing narrative to be &amp;quot;generated&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t like it much either. But how else to do it? You could a special flag to say that in addition to not providing url or data, you are *not providing them*. And that accomplishes what? Else you could impose the requirement that where attachment is used, you also have to have an attribute that says &amp;quot;not available for this language&amp;quot; - it&amp;#39;s moving deck chairs around the titanic for what is an edge case. And the current way follows naturally - I have a mime type, and a language, and no content - I guess there isn&amp;#39;t any content then&lt;/p&gt;

The argument given in the comment are not pursuasive. The current profiling on contract is not large. The committee membership indicates that there are indeed organizations that manage consents and non-consent contracts in the&amp;nbsp; same way.&amp;nbsp; Further given the context elements in contract, it is easy enough to determine patient specific contracts from non, and consents from simply patient specific contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

The questionnaire can reference to another FHIR resource. You can use questionnaire for all kinds of queries, but you can&amp;#39;t do very much with the answers.

Proposal:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
- make it clear that repeating surname and given are part of the same name, where a person has multiple given names or surnames&lt;br /&gt;
- make the relationship between parts and text explicit (but not cultural dependence)&lt;br /&gt;
- emphasize the importance of the text element&lt;/p&gt;

Vote: 3/19/2025 SDWG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Motion by Rick, 2nd by Brett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oppose: 0, Abstain: 0, For 22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Leave the Composition.type definition as is, and update DocumentReference.type definition to match.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Leave Composition.class definition as is&amp;nbsp;and make DocumentReference.class match, but&amp;nbsp;append to both a note that explicitly states that this is a metadata field from XDS/MHD and point directly to those IHE specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
",3633
"===",5561,"Reason",6,"&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SDWG feels that the new definition of class in DocumentReference is circular (says&amp;nbsp;that the class code is the classification) and overlaps with the document type codes that one would put in Composition.type.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many SDWG members feel that Composition.class should be removed from core and added as an extension to MHD, since it is not needed for the general Compositon/Document use case, certainly not by 80% of users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Marking status as approved because we agreed to make a change, but we feel the tracker needs an equivalent status for Not Persuasive with Mod.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Propose to add &amp;nbsp;a regex that tests whether the reference has an address that is consistent with the FHIR API or not. Note that references don&amp;#39;t have to conform to the FHIR API (some resources, particularly conformance ones, might just be static files on a web server somewhere) but this allows you to know whether you are dealing with something that you can ask for a conformance statement from&lt;/p&gt;

Add &amp;#39;unknown&amp;#39; to Observation.status Value set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#39;Note that&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; is a value of last resort and every attempt should be made to provide a meaningful value other than &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When mapping data from some systems into FHIR, there&amp;#39;s no way to accurately map Observation.status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than default to final, it&amp;#39;d be preferable to have some way to indicate that the status is not known, either by making status optional or adding an &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; to the valueset. After discussion, the preference was for the &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; enum with words of caution saying that it should only be used when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Add a new parameter to the $expand operation: &amp;#39;profile&amp;#39; that refers to an external definition of additional configuration for the expansion. For now, there would be no formal definition of a resource for that profile, just a note that &amp;quot;The VSAC Documentation (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/authorguidelines/updatingvaluesets.html) provides one example of the use of this parameter. &amp;nbsp;Implementers using this element will need to agree on an appropriate mechanism for use within their interoperability community&amp;quot;, with the intent that if there&amp;#39;s any emerging consensus about this, we will go on and develop a resource for it a future version of FHIR&lt;/p&gt;
