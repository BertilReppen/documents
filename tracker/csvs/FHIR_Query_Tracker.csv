There are several errors in the sample NZ discharge summary document-example-dischargesummary(father).xml, including an invented UCUM code 'tbl'. I also recall in another sample, a code 'g/cm-2' also claiming to be a UCUM code.<br />
there are also the LOINC mismatch errors (molar concentration instead of mass concentration)<br />

Questionnaire.group.name says that it's a structured name that identifies the question within the questionnaire or group.  However, its data type is a CodeableConcept.</p>

<p>
There are two requirements.  One is a label that serves as a unique identifier.  E.g. ""Question 1"" or ""II.b3"".  These only have meaning/relevance within the context of a single questionnaire.  The second is a need to identify the a question in a questionnaire as being ""the same"" as a standardized question defined in some ontology (a list of CDEs, a code system like LOINC, etc.) and/or as a question that might appear in other questionnaires or even other locations within the same questionnaire.  For this, ""CodeableConcept"" is an appropriate data type.</p>

I think we need to split ""name"" into these two distinct concepts.  The second one might be a candidate to bump to an extension.  In either case, we should probably look at the name ""name"" and verify it's going to make sense to domain experts.  (Because at first blush, I thought it was equivalent to Observation.name and Procedure.name . . .</p>

Composite search params given an elegant way of allowing any combination of AND and OR terms using repeated keys and comma separation.

<p>
A simple suggested enhancement follows.</p>

<p>
----</p>

<p>
The result of the search operation is the intersection of the resources that match the criteria specified by each individual search parameter. If a parameter repeats, such as /patient?language=FR&amp;language=NL, then this matches a patient who speaks both languages. &lt;new&gt;This is known as an AND query parameter, since the server is expected to respond only with results which match both values. &lt;/new&gt;</p>

<p>
If, instead, the search is to find patients that speak either language, then this is a single parameter with multiple values, separated by a ',': &lt;new&gt; for example &lt;/new&gt; ""/patient?language=FR,NL"". &lt;new&gt;This is known as an OR query parameter, since the server is expected to respond with results which match either value.</p>

<p>
AND parameters and OR parameters may also be combined, for example: ""/patient?language=FR,NL&amp;language=EN"" would refer to any patient who speaks English as well as either French or Dutch.&lt;/new&gt;</p>

The definition for parameter chaining is weak in the specification.</p>

<p>
Per a discussion with Graham on the Skype chat, the current intended use is for chain to be used as the dot notation is often used for FHIR paths. E.g. if I can search by Observation.subject.identifier then I should see a search parameter like &lt;searchParam&gt;&lt;name=""subject""/&gt;&lt;chain value=""identifier""/&gt;&lt;/searchParam&gt;</p>

<p>
This is weak IMO for several reasons:</p>

<p>
1. The dot notation is used everywhere else. It should be allowable within a search param as well. Chaining as a substitute notation is just confusing.</p>

<p>
2. I would prefer chaining to be used to specify allowable combinations of parameters. I.e. If i allow searching for an observation by aubject and name, I could do something like &lt;searchParam&gt;&lt;name=""subject.identifier""/&gt;&lt;chain value=""name""/&gt;&lt;/searchParam&gt;</p>

<p>
The counter argument to #2 (offered by Grahame G) is that this leads to permutation explosion in the case of servers (such as his) that support a large number of query parameters and allow any possible combination of those params. My counter-counter argument to that is that this is an edge case, since well over 80% of real world systems have a very limited number of actual allowable search parameters that they can compute efficiently.</p>

<p>
In addition, the status quo makes conformance profiles ambiguous since there is no way of spelling out which exact combinations of parameters are valid, only which combinations are theoreticallly possible. This type of ambiguity is desirable elsewhere in the spec, but should absolutely not be allowed in conformance.</p>

<p>
A possible reolution to Grahame's objection would be some sort of ""*"" notation?</p>

In no case is it possible to place a code into an expansion without knowing, at that point, the coding system to which it belongs.

That, in turn, is needed because there is potentially information about the code that is known by the coding system, but not the value set (e.g. in the case of an import, where you'd have to look at the referenced value set to get its in-lined coding system to find out if a code is abstract or not).</p>

[7:54:01 AM] Josh Mandel: I think putting a reminder there is odd + confusing though, because of course every parameter has to be url-encoded all the time. Like ... we don't write that ""/Patient?identifier=<a href=""http://acme.org/patient%7C2345"">http://acme.org/patient|2345</a>"" needs ot be escaped as ""/Patient?identifier=http%3A%2F%2Facme.org%2Fpatient%7C2345"" -- even though it does.<br />

<p>
These codes raise huge confidentiality disclosure issues and are not a match to the administrative needs. Diagnoses like undifferentiated are among some of the most sensitive medical diagnoses, and do not belong in widely disseminated information.</p>

<p>
The HL7 V2.x codes correspond to normal practice:</p>

<p>
M - Use male assigned administrative practices, e.g., for room assignments.<br />
F - Use female assigned administrative practices, e.g., for room assignments.<br />
U - Administrative practices not yet selected. Typical for early trauma cases where treatment proceeds without waiting for identification details like sex determination.<br />
N - Sex related administrative practices do not apply to this patient. This can arise when patient is also used to track inanimate objects.<br />
O - Other (rare) for special cases with other administrative practices.</p>

<p>
I expect this list would be extended for veterinary uses, where things like stall assignment may be different for free martin, martingale, heifer, cow, steer, and bull.</p>

<p>
The code ""N"" is from HL7 v2.x.  This could also be ""O"".  I've seen it used primarily for quality phantoms, etc.  These should go through the same software as patients, since the software is an important part of the quality test, but don't have a meaningful sex category.  I don't know the full rationale behind this original choice.  I assume it's because there are occasionally real humans with special needs and they didn't want to mix them in with the inanimate test subjects.</p>

Per <a href=""http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/securityevent.html#comment-1416753700"">Llyod's advice on question I posted on missing search parameter paths</a> for the SecurityEvent resource I propose the following change:</p>

<p>
In addition to defiinng a 'path' for a search parameter to indicate the precise extent of the resource data used to determine a match using the well-defined resource-independent search keys and qualifiers, FHIR needs a model-driven way to specify a resource-specific algorithm used with some search parameter to account for a few of the search scenarios that have been defined without a specific search paramter path.</p>

<p>
Candidates in the DSTU 1 (Search parameters with no search key) include:</p>

<p>
* ImagingStudy: size<br />
* Location: near &amp; nearDistance<br />
* Organization: phonetic<br />
* Patient: phonetic<br />
* RelatedPerson: phonetic<br />
* SecurityEvent: patientId</p>

<p>
Location's near and nearDistance is a good example as the alogorithm for detemrining 'nearness' could be based on included GPS coordinates or inferred from a street address, etc.  so its not entirely clear which element(s) of the resource would or could represent the 'path' for that parameter.</p>

<p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: Without some additional metainformation it is unclear if a path is missing because the model is incomplete or if a missing path is supposed to imply a search parameter with a resource-specific matchign algorithm.  For model-driven code generators a little more metainfo in the model would help.</p>

<p>
<strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> To make the intent of the model defining this resource precise adding metadata to the model to indicate that the parameter's mathcing logic is 'resource specific' and defined in the definition comment.  With this metainfo a generated implementation knows a general purpose resource-independent matching algorithm (like a string match or date range search on a particular element) won't suffice and that one specific to that named parameter on that particular resource will need to be used at runtime and supplied by the implementator (i.e. not generated).   </p>

<p>
And, if we expect there is a future need to support multiple named matching algorithms for the same logical named search parameter that could be handled without further modification to FHIR metamodel by creating separate named parameters with different suffixes indicating the different matching algorithm.  This would avoid formally introducing support into the metamodel for multiple runtime-selectable named algorithms on the same logical search parameter, something that, so far anyway, appears to be very rare in the FHIR model.</p>

<p>
<strong>Affected Resources: </strong>Potentially impacts the 6 resources listed above.  I can't tell if they all count as resource-specific search parameters, but these 6 are the resources that have some empty search paths and are potential candidates for marking as 'resource-specific' search parameters. </p>

<p>So by making virtually all the examples have contained resources  a) suggests that its always the case that the inline content like diagnostic order or observation or patient don't have an independeent existence and b) that this an acceptable way to send reports instead of resource bundles and 3) since developers are prone to copying examples rather than reading the fat spec, this is setting a bad precedent.</p>

The current definition of Observation.subject is:<br /><br />
""The thing the observation is being made about.""<br /><br />
I'm working with an implementer on adopting observation, and we've<br />
found a need to define a new extension, but I think that this shows we<br />
need a better definition on the observation.<br /><br />
There's 2 use cases we need to deal with:<br />
* a fetal heartbeat - the mother is the subject, the LIONC code is<br />
[fetal heartrate], and fetus is [fetus 2] - the last bit is the<br />
extension<br />
* the second case is in social medicine/psychology, where you're<br />
talking to a patient (or, more likely, ""client""), and you make an </p>

<p>
observation about their spouse (or other relation). </p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Note: there's really 2 variations on this - you're taking </p>

<p>
a patient's history, and gather some information from </p>

<p>
their spouse (perhaps they're unconscious), </p>

<p>
or, you're counselling a patient, and make </p>

<p>
observations about their spouse as part of the process.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
The first is an observation about the spouse with the </p>

<p>
person you're talking to as an informant. And it belongs</p>

<p>
in the spouse's record. But the second, it's not. This</p>

<p>
is not an observation you can put in the spouse's</p>

<p>
record, and it's not even about them. In fact, the target</p>

<p>
of the observation may not be identified any better than</p>

<p>
""spouse"" (or ""boss"", or ""(hl7) colleague ;-)). The subject </p>

<p>
of the observation is the person you're treating/whatever.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
So there's an extension here - kind of like body site, </p>

<p>
but 'remote' body site. I still need to clarify the exact </p>

<p>
definition of the extension, but whatever it is, I think </p>

<p>
this shows that a better definition of Observation.subject </p>

<p>
is needed. Suggested wording:</p>

<p>
<br />
Subject: The person/device/etc. whose record this observation is<br />
associated with and whose characteristics (direct or indirect) are<br />
described by the observation<br />
Comments: Indirect characteristics may be those of a specimen, fetus,<br />
relative, etc.<br /><br />

At present, version aware updates are done this way:</p>

<p>
In particular, servers may choose to implement version-aware updates, where the only updates that are accepted quote the current version of the resource. In this case, the client must submit the currently correct version specific URL in the Content-Location in the PUT request. If the value is missing, the server SHALL return a 412 Preconditions failed response. Clients SHOULD submit a proper Content-Location header and SHALL correctly understand a 409 response as an update conflict.</p>

<p>
The normal way to do this in other RESTful APIs is to use etags. Early drafts of FHIR used eTags, but this was removed because of privacy concerns that had been identified. However these have not meant that eTag usage has been replaced, and the eTag approach is better - (see comments thread here: <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#comment-1535338227"">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#comment-1535338227</a>)</p>

When referencing structures and extensions (either from a Tag or profile element in TypeRef), the ""anchor"" part of the structure/extension url is optional.  In DSTU1 it is not clear how to resolve these references in every case, which is complicated even more by the fact that Structure.name is optional. An example is where the TypeRef.code is ""ResourceReference"" and the TypeRef.profile has no #anchor.  For other cases, the Structure.type has to be considered if Structure.name is missing and rules about Structure.Public further complicate type resolution.  As well, both ExtensionDefn and Structure are top-level Profile constructs that can be addressed by a url #anchor, but the element is called ""code"" in ExtensionDefn and ""name"" in Structure. Finally, while teaching I see constant confusion about the difference between a ""profile"" a ""profile url without anchor"" a ""profile url with anchor"" and the role of structure.name.  I propose the following:</p>

<p>
* Rename ExtensionDefn.code to ExtensionDefn.name (to make it consistent with Structure.name)</p>

<p>
* Make Structure.name 1..1 (to make it consistent with ExtensionDefn.name). This will remove the need for ""fallback"" resolution based on Structure.type</p>

<p>
* Abolish the term ""profile reference"" and force ""structure references"" and ""extension references"" to always include an anchor.</p>

There are difficulties in mapping a health workers name into the FHIR model, especially if the name is stored in a structured way.  It is quite common for a country to have multiple components in a name.

<p>
Another issue is that LDAP data models are often in use (e.g. from HPD). Here the common name can be repeated multiple times.  If practitioner.name.text was 0..*, one could easily map the common name into the FHIR representaiton.   Note, in LDAP there is no ""preferred"" common name so there is no need to distringuish them.</p>

On another note, in the narrative for the address data type, it referes to a ""postal address.""  In Uganda and Zambia (for example) a postal address is a distinct notion from a physical address, although both should be capture by the address data type.   I would suggest changing ""postal address"" to simply ""address"" in the narrative.<br />

<p>
<br />
[11:21:23 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: I don't *think* it makes sense to extend extension if you've got a value.  You can extend the value[x] element<br />
[11:22:28 AM] Paul Knapp: and structurally I read the text to say you cannot have both though that may not be the intention<br />
[11:23:03 AM] Josh Mandel: Fascinating -- that's a third option I hadn't considered. So when I want to represent an extension with two fields in it, I can do:</p>

<p>
extension:<br />
  extension a<br />
  extension b</p>

<p>
extension:<br />
  value a<br />
  extension b</p>

<p>
extension:<br />
  value a:<br />
    extension b<br />
[11:25:07 AM] Paul Knapp: but only the first is two children. I see that there are two additional elements in the aggregate but I don't think #2 is valid according to the language though 1 and 3 are. #1 to me says 2 children, #3 say child and grandchild.<br />
[11:26:16 AM] Paul Knapp: actually #3 is a child with issues<br />
[11:26:18 AM] Josh Mandel: Paul, when I think about it though, #2 has to be valid. I mean if </p>

<p>
extension:<br />
  value a</p>

<p>
 is valid unto itself, and extensions are extensible... then surely I can add ""extension b"" to it without breaking it (or even changing its meaning)?<br />
[11:27:21 AM] Paul Knapp: you can add an extension to the value a, but not to the extension given the 'you can have either a value or an extension' text above<br />
[11:27:50 AM] Paul Knapp: so #3 follows that pattern<br />
[11:29:24 AM] Paul Knapp: so this goes to your initial question Josh, as in can you have a value and an, or more than one, extension on the same extension<br />
[11:29:45 AM] Josh Mandel: Exactly. FWIW, current parsers and serializers accept #2 :-)<br />
[11:31:28 AM] Paul Knapp: I think the 'you can't have both' text is at odds with the use of extensions eslewher and that implementations have applied extensions consistently hence they allow #2.<br />
[11:31:47 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: Extensions on extension are intended to define complex extensions.  You can't have a complex extension and a value<br />
[11:32:25 AM] Josh Mandel: Okay. I ran across this ""in the wild"", which is why I brought it up here.<br />
[11:33:04 AM] Paul Knapp: If we aren't going to allow extensions to contain multiple children, and I'm questioning why we don't - maybe we should discuss in Chicago, then your #2 would be my choice for a fallback.<br />
[11:33:50 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: Extensions can contain either a single value or multiple extensions<br />
[11:34:11 AM] Paul Knapp: @Lloyd, so why don't we say 'if you want to define a complex extension you can't have a value.<br />
[11:34:20 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: We should<br />
[11:35:27 AM] Paul Knapp: Correction to my above I meant #1 NOT #2<br />
[11:35:52 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: #1 and #3 are both valid<br />
[11:36:52 AM] Paul Knapp: and to my point on the FMG call Wednesday, you can't have multiple values on an extension as we see above. You simulate multiple values with multiple extensions.<br />
[11:36:56 AM] James Agnew: The spec doesn’t look ambiguous to me?<br />
[11:37:00 AM] James Agnew: “An extension SHALL have either a value (i.e. a value[x] element) or child extensions.”<br />
[11:37:17 AM] James Agnew: You can have a value, OR you can have child extensions<br />
[11:39:23 AM] James Agnew: I guess it’s less clear on whether you should be allowed to extend an extension value, but my goodness would that be confusing. That shouldn’t be ok<br />
[11:45:44 AM] Paul Knapp: While I agree you can quickly build a complex 3D mess, its clear to me that that is both allowed and intended. Especially usefull if that is what you need to convey :(<br />
[11:52:58 AM] James Agnew: I would think that if you have the need to convey in an extension “a string and an extension to that string” you could just define an extension with those two values as “root elements”<br />
[11:53:32 AM] James Agnew: ..also i’d say it appears to be allowed, but is it intended? There certainly aren’t any examples I’ve come across that do that...<br />
[12:08:00 PM] Josh Mandel: @James I actually found the language ambigiuous. For me "", but not both"" would certainly clinch it.<br />
[12:08:20 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: Change request away :)<br />
[12:08:29 PM] Josh Mandel: I shall, if that's the intended meaning.<br />
[12:08:40 PM] Josh Mandel: Given that parsers, etc allow it though, I wasn't sure.<br />

All resources have an id property that is presently documented as ""metadata"" - that is, it's a property of every resource that lives outside the resource, not inside it. I propose that we put this back inside the resource.<br /><br />
Background:<br /><br />
In the early drafts of the specification, every resource included an ""id"" element/property, like so:<br /><br />
&lt;Patient xmlns=""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>""&gt;<br />
  &lt;id value=""[logical-id]""/&gt;<br /><br />
This is the id that is used in the url: GET [base]/Patient/[logical-id]. In doing this, we followed the pattern used by every other RESTful API I've come across, in that the id is right there inside the resource.<br /><br />
At the 2nd connectathon, we observed that the id was basically a duplicate. Whenever you exchange the resource using http or wrap it in atom, the id is duplicated in the envelope, and all any of us were doing is cross-checking it as a sanity check.  So we removed it (a discussion that you can go back and review on the mail list, if you really core. It was a little controversial).<br /><br />
What this means is that if you represent the resource outside an http call, or an atom feed, you need to make your own arrangements for keeping the id (and potentially other metadata) associated with the resource. This is described here: <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resources.html#metadata"">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resources.html#metadata</a><br /><br />
Problem<br /><br />
While the current arrangement works, it's unexpected to many implementers. This is a common question for many implementers when they start working with FHIR - where's the id? And the fact that it is not in the resource means that other arrangements have to be made, which makes it more difficult to use FHIR in practice. (Josh ballotted about this for exactly these reasons on the DSTU), but withdrew when he could see that the discussion was going to be complex. However I think we have more broad experience with this and we can have a better discussion now. <br /><br />
After watching the discussion since we made this decision, and after implementing other RESTful APIs, I've come to the conclusion that we made the wrong decision: while, from a theorist point of view, the id is unncessary, since it is *usually* duplicated, in practice, this is not something where we should deviate from the norm (especially since our rationale applies fully to every other RESTful API, it's not something unique to us)<br /><br />
Hence, I propose to restore the id back into the resource<br /><br />
Notes:<br />
- it would be &lt;id value=""[logical-id]""/&gt; in xml, no extensions, and ""id"" : ""logical-id"" in JSON. </p>

<p>
- it's mandatory in all contexts except when a resource is submitted as a create operation</p>

<p>
- there was this idea that putting the id outside the resource made the resource easier to sign, but that doesn't really work since the id is in resource references</p>

<p>
- we currently ban ""id"" elements from resources, so there's no existing elements to clash with </p>

Here is a quote from section 2.1.19, Paging:</p>

<p>
If servers provide paging for the results of a search or history interaction, they SHALL conform to the method described in RFC 5005 (Feed Paging and Archiving) for sending continuation links to the client when returning a bundle (e.g. with history and search). If the server does not do this, there is no way to continue paging. </p>

<p>
RFC5005 has the following in section 1.1 Notational Conventions:</p>

<p>
  This specification uses XML Namespaces [3] to uniquely identify XML<br />
   element names.  It uses the following namespace prefix for the<br />
   indicated namespace URI;</p>

<p>
   ""fh"": ""<a href=""http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0"">http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0</a>""</p>

<p>
However, the FHIR atom schemas do not include that namespace declaration, thus any bundle that actually follows the RFC will be invalid according to the FHIR schemas. Please add that namespace to the schemas when they are generated, as well as the elements called out in the RFC (i.e. &lt;fh:complete/&gt; and &lt;fh:archive/&gt;).  </p>

By combining these into a single element, multiple relationships can be expressed for a given person.</p>

<p>I've attached a proposed update to the RelatedPerson resource. I've also included an update to the cardinality for name to make it required and to allow for a history of names (similar to Patient).</p>

<p>Use case example 1: A parent can be related to each of his/her children from a single RelatedPerson resource. Same goes for any other person with multiple relationships to patients.

<p>Use case example 2: For data interoperability, where FHIR resources may be centralized as reference data for patient matching and record location, custodianship of Patient resources is distributed across members of a data sharing community. In this case, a RelatedPerson resource would be shared by the community. And while members of this community could establish uni-directional links to remote Patient resources under their control, they could not do the same for the remote Patient resource. In this case, a RelatedPerson resource (with two entries for patient relationships and each with the PatientRelationshipType ONESELF) would facilitate efficient and reliable record location services.</p>

""operations.html"" says:</p>

<p>
&gt; Name clashes between operations defined by different implementers can be resolved by use of the <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/conformance.html"">conformance statement</a>.</p>

<p>
But this is not an adequate approach.</p>

<p>
To start: Operation's ""identifier"" is optional, and the official operations don't currently even include an identifier (e.g. there is no OperationDefinition.identifier defined for <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operation-conceptmap-translate.xml"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operation-conceptmap-translate.xml</a> or <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operation-valueset-expand.xml"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operation-valueset-expand.xml</a>). Without an identifier on the operation definitoin, a client has no chance of telling two operations apart.</p>

<p>
But more to the point, the currnet approach to namespacing is flawed because of the interaction between ""OperationDefinition.identifier"" and ""OperationDefinition.name"": even if ""identifier"" is present, each operation definition still declares its own name, which determines the URL at which it is hosted. So for example, the following can occur:</p>

<p>
1. An implementer defines and imlplements a new operation, used locally, called ""$test"" (with or without an identifier).</p>

<p>
2. Later, FHIR defines an official operation called ""$test"" that does something different,</p>

<p>
3. The implementer wants to support both, but can't, because they share the same name and thus would need to be hosted at the same URL.</p>

<p>
One solution: FHIR could define  its own ""official"" operations ot have privileged names, e.g. by using a prefix like ""fhir."", which  would yield names like ""$fhir.translate"" and ""$fhir.populate"". Then implementers would know not to define new operations whose names start with ""fhir."".</p>

<p>
[2014-09-29, 2:04:03 PM] James Agnew: in the case of one system we have a fhir interface in front of right now, there isn’t even that. it just overwrites the previous version with the new version and keeps the id the same.. doesn’t even have an update timestamp.<br />
[2014-09-29, 2:04:25 PM] James Agnew: this sure wouldn’t be how i would design a system, but i don’t control the system, just want to put data in it<br />
[2014-09-29, 2:07:13 PM] Paul Knapp: if they put a timestamp on it then that could server as the instance/version, but agreed when you don't control it you don't control it.<br />
[2014-09-29, 3:25:38 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: If you have no idea when the data is changed, then you don't really have a choice other than to declare a distinct verison every time the data is queried<br />
[2014-09-29, 3:25:57 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: So set the version id to a random guid or to the current timestamp<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:21:45 PM] Grahame Grieve: this is problematic. Where does it say that the version id has to change?<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:31:58 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: When the data changes?<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:32:57 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: 1.12.0 (resources.html): ""has an identified version that changes if the contents of the resource change""<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:35:05 PM] Grahame Grieve: well, James, I think that the spec is clear: that you do have to have a version id, and it does have to change.<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:35:19 PM] Grahame Grieve: but I'm inclined to agree with you that this is problematic<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:35:47 PM] Grahame Grieve: Lloyd's solution - nventing a version id for every view - doesn't sit well with me either<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:36:51 PM] Lloyd McKenzie: I agree it's a sucky solution.  It's a worst case where your sole back-end is v2 messaging that has no concept of dates or version ids or anything else that could be used to generate a version id<br />
[2014-09-29, 4:37:57 PM] Grahame Grieve: it would be better not to do a version id at all.<br />

Currently, in FHIR, body site is modeled in two ways: as a structure (Location in Condition) and as an attribute (bodySite - CodeableConcept).</p>

<p>
CDS would like to recommend that the approach to modeling body site be consistent and we would favor the Location approach (see Condition) over the bodySite attribute as it allows for a cleaner extension approach. In CDS, we plan to add to extensions to Location - i.e., directionality and laterality beyond the anatomical location code.</p>

<p>
We assume that in FHIR, anatomical location may precoordinate directionality and laterality. This may be common in most systems today. However, such precoordination can be problematic for more computable use cases (e.g., logic checks based on a cross-product of qualifier/location combinations, parsing of precoordinated concepts, or even cases where terminologies are not fully consistent in their precoordination). We also would like to recommend the addition of the laterality and directionality to the Location structure for those use cases where post-coordination in the model is possible.</p>

This info is not contained in the valueset anywhere, structured or unstructured (I'm basing on the Value Set resource definition and published instances thereof).

Currently, the Profile fixed value (<strong>Profile.structure.snapshot.element.definition.value[x]</strong>) has a short description that says ""Fixed value: [as defined for a primitive type]"", and the comments say: To specify a fixed value for a complex data type, include the child elements for the type and specify fixed values for each property independently. However the type is ""*"" - allows complex types, and the existing profile tooling generates complex fixed values. </p>

<p>
What you want depends on the context. The classic case is a codableConcept - sometimes, particularly in the spec, you want to fix, say, a particular code by system/code, but it's not important - or even useful - if other codes are provided. On the other hand, it's really relevant, particularly in implementation guides, to simply fix the value completely, and making the tooling or the author blow out all the sub children in order to fix a full value is definitely overkill. </p>

<p>
This proposal is to allow for fixed[x] to be complex type, and if a fixed value is specified, then that exact fixed value must be used, with no deviation. Also to add a pattern[x] : * element, with cardinality 0..1. If this is fixed, the provided element must conform to the pattern - in other words, each element / attribute / property (for JSON) must exist in the instance, but other things may also exist. This is effectively constraint by example</p>

At present, any slicing on a list requires a discriminator. The discriminator is a field that must have a distinct value domain in each slice, and an instance processor can use the value of the discriminator to determine which slice it is dealing with without having to do speculative depth-first validation of the entire slice contents to decide which slice they are dealing with (which may be impossible, let alone feasible in computational or programmer terms)</p>

<p>
However there are some cases where there is no possible discriminator, and there's no way to tell the content apart without full validation. And there are other cases - including a couple in CDA - where there is no single discriminator. </p>

<p>
This task proposes to change the cardinality of discriminator from 1..1 to 0..*. If there is one or more discriminator fields nominated, then the set of the the value domains must be unique across the defined slices. If there is no discriminator, then there is no easy to determine which slice is which (implementers are advised not to do this, but an choose to). </p>

"===",3623,3,"2014-10-11 11:41:11+00","","Clarify how re-slicing works across profiles","<p>
Currently, when you slice, you define a name for each new slice. The name has to be unique across the set of slices in the profile. So if profile A defines an element X with cardinality 0..*, and profile B is derived from profile A, then profile B can either:<br />
#1 make a constraint on X with no name - in which case the profile is constraining all appearances of X; or <br />
#2 make a constraint on X with a name - in which case the profile is describing a specific slice on X, and the constraints only apply to that slice; or <br />
#3 it can do both</p>

<p>
Then, profile C derives from profile B. Profile C can do the following:</p>

<p>
#1 make a constraint on X with no name - in which case the profile is constraining all appearances of X; or <br />
#2 make a constraint on X with a different name to that used in profile B - in which case the profile is describing a specific new slice on X, and the constraints only apply to that slice; or <br />
​#3 make a constraint on X with the same name as that used in profile B - in which case the profile is making new constraints on the slice defined in profile B; or <br />
#4 - some combination of the above options</p>

<p>
Note: it is possible for Profile C to make rules that are incompatible with profile B, in which case there is no set of instances that can be valid against profile C</p>

<p>
What is not clear is how Profile C slices the slice defined by Profile B. This task proposes that this is achieved by a path separator - if Profile B defines the slice ""example"", and profile C defines the slice ""example/example1"", then this is deemed to be ""example1"" slice of the example slice. Note: we could choose any character as the separator character; we choose / since that is what openEHR uses for pretty much the same usage. </p>

When search criteria are defined based on a resource, tying them to a structure makes good sense.  However, when search criteria are defined against extension definitions, requiring a structure is unnecessary.  The search criteria would apply wherever the extension gets used and best practice is for extensions to be defined separately from profiles.  Also, if I want to define an additional search criteria for a resource, it's not clear why I should have to create a structure to do that.  It's probably cleanest if search criteria simply point to the resource(s) they work with rather than having to define a separate structure for them to nest inside.</p>

At present, a profile is a packaging mechanism for a set of Structural constraints, and a set of extension definitions. It was defined that why before we had any other packaging mechanisms. Structured like this, it's a pretty *big* resource (as can be seen by looking at it's definitions) and it creates some difficulties:<br />
* it's not clear what a ""profile"" is - since many people refer to a structure as a profile<br />
* it complicates the URL handling/addressing - it's not clear which structure is being addressed<br />
* there's no real logical boundary - it's just an editing / packaging convenience, but it's also a editing / package problem too</p>

<p>
A specific problem is that it makes FHIR not play well with other metadata registries. For instance, they could host a general data element repository where the URL for a data element (say, <a href=""http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/398625"">http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/398625</a>) could serve up an extension definition if the content type on the request is ""application/xml+fhir"". But as it stands, we either have to continue allowing ambiguity about package references, or prohibit the same URL directly </p>

<p>
Instead, we could break extensions and structures up - into ExtensionDefinition, and Profile. They would both have the same metadata as now, but a profile would have one structure, and an extension definition would have one extension. Most of the existing common content would be moved to a shared data type called ""ElementDefinition"" so they'd continue to have common content where they currently do. </p>

<p>
This would simplify implementation for authors, validators and users because there'd be no ambiguity about the fragment part of the URL. Nor would there be ambiguity about what a ""profile"" is.</p>

<p>
We could still do packaging, but it would be done by atom or composition, and we'd get more flexibility - could include value sets, operation definitions, etc. </p>

The role of OperationOutcome and the boundary between this resource and other more application-level response resources should be clarified so that implementers and designers are clear as to when OperationOutcome can be used as an application response as opposed to a transmission-level response resource, and when it is more appropriate to look to other, or a new, application response to meet a business need.</p>

<p>
Suggestion: To serve as a light application response role OperationOutcome needs to have additional elements such as a business identifier, status etc. Severity should include success.</p>

Also, guidance on the use or replacement of the type valueset would be useful.</p>

<p>
Lloyd had suggested that an extension be optionally allowed to reference a resource which contains richer application-level information, for example a RESTful create of a dispense could result in an OperationOutcome. which contains errors and a reference to a Contraindication resource. Paul felt that if this is an appropriate usage then the reference would be infrastructural and therefore should not be an extension but an optional core element. </p>

Many applications have a need for the API server to return all entries related to a patient. This can be best accomplished by providing the Paitent ID.</p>

<p>
It seems that there are a couple means (among others) to return the entire patient entry list.<br />
1) Create a function that searches all resource types to return results from the /_search?... supported query accross the entire server. Since some resources have the patient idenifier as ""patient"", ""subject"", and ""identifier"", seperate queires may have to be executed andcombined.<br />
2) Support the /_search? query acorss the entire server and ensure that all entries use a common patient identifier in the spec.<br />

At present, it's not possible to find contained resources when searching. As an example, imagine a contained value set in a questionnaire. You can search the value sets, but you can't search for this particular value set - it's ignored in the search. Mostly, actually, that's the behaviour you want. But not always. Say, you want to find all places where a particular code systems is used in the system - you also want to search contained value sets.</p>

<p>
But right now, you can't. You can search all the questionnaires for ones that refer to value sets that use that code system, but this will include both contained and non-contained examples. And where do you have to search to find the contained value set? everything? </p>

<p>
This task proposes making the following changes: <br />
* add a search parameter ""_contained"" that can either be ""true"", ""false"", or ""both"". The default is false<br />
* specify that when contained resources are matched, their container resources is returned <br />
* differentiate between matching and included resources in what is returned (depends on task to replace atom) (so that it's possible to tell whether a resoruce is included as a match or an inclusion, which presently is done solely by type)</p>

There's a need for clinical decision support and other purposes to be able to represent proposals/recommendations an planned activities such as proposal for medication, planned observation, etc.  The data captured for these is typically similar to or identical to the information captured for orders.  The only difference is that proposed and planned activities are not ""authorized"" (and thus may not be directly actionable).</p>

<p>
The proposal is to leverage the existing order/request/intent resources (MedicationPrescription, DiagnosticOrder, Referral, NutritionOrder, ProcedureOrder, CarePlan, plus new ones) but allow them to convey ""plans"" and ""proposals"" for activities in addition to the actual order of an activity.</p>

<p>
There are two options:</p>

<p>
1. This could be done using either an immutable element on the resource to distinguish Proposal|Plan|Order (and possibly other things, e.g. ""Promise"").  Orders that implement plans or proposals would need to be separate instances.  Proposals and plans would be able to navigate the entire status cycle.</p>

<p>
2. This could be done by adding ""proposed"" (and where appropriate, ""planned"") as statuses to the existing structure.  In this case, proposals could be updated to become ""active"" (though distinct instances would still be possible).  Once the status had changed to completed or something else, there'd no longer be a distinction about whether the original had been a ""proposal"" or not though.</p>

From very early in the design of FHIR, we've used Atom feeds as our syntax for bundling resources. We use bundles of resources for search results, transactions, messages, and documents - quite a lot, in fact. It's one of the prominent features of our API (I've sometimes referred to it as an Atom spec, not a RESTful spec). And one of the obvious ways it works - which has been controversial - is that we put resource metadata outside the resource, in the http header, or in the Atom entry wrapper.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
In the last few weeks, several long-running threads have come together to convince the core team that this is a problem, and that if we're ever going to address it, now is the time. The primary trigger was a discussion on the FHIR implementers skype channel that followed on from our earlier email thread about re-introducing “id” into the base resource. If you care, this is visible in our skype <a href=""https://chats.fhir.me/feeds/skype/implementers.html""><u>chat logs</u></a> (specifically around <a href=""https://chats.fhir.me/feeds/skype/implementers.html#2014-09-3020:07:15Z""><u>here</u></a> -- and if you read this, scroll up, not down).</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Anyway, the upshot of that discussion was that we were persuaded to take a serious look at changing from Atom (even though we weren't keen - it's a very large change for the core team). But as I said, it's kind of now or never (I'm trying to get all the breaking changes done at once).</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
So we’re proposing to add this kind of metadata (in JSON or XML) to every resource:</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
""meta"" : {<br />
   ""id"" : ""23434"",<br />
   ""versionId"" : ""12"",<br />
   ""lastUpdated"" : ""2014-08-18T01:43:30Z"",<br />
   ""ruleSet"" : ""<a href=""http://example-consortium.org/fhir/consortium-rules"">http://example-consortium.org/fhir/consortium-rules</a>"",<br />
   ""profile"" : [""<a href=""http://example-consortium.org/fhir/Profile/patient"">http://example-consortium.org/fhir/Profile/patient</a>""],<br />
   ""security"" : [{<br />
     ""system"" : ""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode"">http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode</a>"",<br />
     ""code"" : ""EMP""<br />
   }],<br />
   ""tag"" : [{<br />
     ""system"" : ""<a href=""http://example.com/codes/workflow"">http://example.com/codes/workflow</a>"",<br />
     ""code"" : ""needs-review""<br />
   }]<br />
 }<br />
}</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
This includes the relevant things from Atom plus something new: ruleset (in place of the previously discussed ""intrinsic profile"" idea). It also clearly separates a resource's id from its current version id (which can be hard to distinguish in FHIR's Atom-based metadata).</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
We would define some new structures, so the base class model for Resources looks like:</p>

<p>
 <strong>Resource</strong> (defines meta + language)</p>

<p>
  <strong>+- DomainResource</strong> (defines text, extensions, contained - what we know as ""resource"" today)</p>

<p>
  <strong>+- Binary</strong> (same functionality as Binary today, but defined like every other resource)</p>

<p>
  <strong>+- Bundle</strong> (adds links + total + base + items)</p>

<p>
  <strong>+- DeletedResource</strong> (adds resource type : used only in bundles that are history lists to mark deleted resources)</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
All of these resources will be defined the same way as all the existing resources, so that all the of the existing infrastructure just handles them naturally.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Here's some of our reasons why we are entertaining the idea of replacing Atom:</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Resource-specific metadata is located differently when the resource is returned from a Search than it is when the resource is returned for a Read. A client needs to look for metadata (like id, version, update time, tags, etc.) in different places depending on which kind of operation was performed. Defining metadata as part of our resources allows a more consistent client interface, and avoids the need to re-invent wrapper syntax when using FHIR resources outside of REST (e.g. messaging or web sockets).</p>

<p>
Many FHIR client libraries offer API calls that return Atom Entries rather than Resources -- even though we claim to ship resources around. This subtle difference trips lots of implementers over, especially when it comes to keeping track of metadata like resource ids and versions.</p>

<p>
Defining our own Bundle structure lets us re-use FHIR's existing algorithm for handling the conversion between XML and JSON (and this can extend to emerging formats like RDF, when we get there).</p>

<p>
Atom’s design (and XML schema in particular) is more complicated to implement than one we'd design.  For example, Atom allows metadata to be specified in any order, whereas in FHIR XML, all other properties are generally ordered.  This would simplify code-generation from Atom schemas. - and we’ve had other implementers struggle with code generation from the Atom schemas.  (We’re not advocating schema-based code generation - there are better ways such as using the reference implementations.  However, we’d like to support that approach where implementers really want to do it.)</p>

<p>
Using Atom complicates FHIR's mime types: in FHIR XML, we currently have 2 mime types: application/xml+fhir and application/Atom+xml</p>

<p>
Atom requires identifiers to be absolute urls and this is more complicated than simple identifiers, where we can use identifiers more naturally (absolute where appropriate, or just identifiers where appropriate).</p>

<p>
The metadata would have to be  duplicated outside the resource even if we chose to move it into the resource</p>

<p>
A new Bundle format will let us directly express the things we care about, rather than jumping through Atom-specific hoops -- for example to express the total number of search results or document deleted records.</p>

<p>
We can do tags more naturally rather than shoehorning the structures into url pairs in Atom category elements (which are a bit of a problem because these are not used consistently elsewhere anyway)</p>

<p>
Atom requires a “title”, “author” and “published date” for every entry, even though FHIR attaches no meaning to this field.</p>

<p>
Our use of Atom effectively duplicates narrative (in entry.summary and content.[resource].text).</p>

<p>
We could make binary resources work more naturally.  While it wouldn’t have narrative, it could still be described/defined in the same manner as other resources, with the base64 content contained in a single resource element.(this would make it fit into the reference implementations without being a ‘special case’)</p>

<p>
We've never figured out how to implement the /document end point because documents aren't resources. (For example: the /document endpoint is theoretically supposed to return ""a bundle of bundles"". But we've never made this work in our implementations, because an Atom-based Bundle is not, itself, a FHIR resource.). Defining our own Bundle structure would allow FHIR Documents to be first-class resources.</p>

<p>
Atom imposes obligations on the identifiers. For example, ""id"" is a required property. (This is a future issue for flexible query that I've already struggled with, though this issue is over the horizon for most.)</p>

<p>
Atom turns into a problem if we want to talk about extrinsic vs intrinsic tags (that’s an earlier discussion we had about tags that are inherently linked to the content, and others that are ephemeral. Security has some identified use cases where a security tag can’t be removed without explicitly changing the resource, though their analysis is not yet complete).</p>

<p>
There’s some peculiarities in the way CDA identifiers map to FHIR because a document maps to Atom, and so we’re forced to map into Atom - and, in fact, there are still some todos here.</p>

<p>
We've never tried to apply profiles to Atom, but there's reasons to think that we'd need to (value sets for security labels, for instance).</p>

<p>
One of the expected benefits of using Atom was that we could use off-the-shelf libraries that supports Atom.  However, in practice our use of deleted resources, extra links for number of matching records, etc. has meant that off-the-shelf Atom libraries have not been broadly helpful for working with FHIR bundles. (For example, most FHIR client libraries ship with a from-scratch Atom implementation.)</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
There's been both ballot responses and tasks requesting change in this regard. Here's a current task: <a href=""http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=2889&amp;start=0""><u>http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=2889&amp;start=0</u></a></p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
To help illustrate what these proposals mean:</p>

<p>
The new developers' introduction at <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/overview-dev.html""><u>http://hl7-fhir.github.io/overview-dev.html</u></a> describes ""meta"" and how it works (note: this is out of sync completely with the rest of the spec, and has some broken links)</p>

<p>
Definitions for Bundle are at <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/NewBundle.html""><u>http://hl7-fhir.github.io/NewBundle.html</u></a>, and Binary here: <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/binary.html""><u>http://hl7-fhir.github.io/binary.html</u></a> (note that generator build tool doesn't know about all this yet, so binary is shown with the wrong parent there, and ""NewBundle"" is a temporary name. This is as far as I can get without changing the tool for the class structure above)</p>

<p>
<br />
 </p>

<p>
Some notes about all this:</p>

<p>
There's nearly zero functional impact here - this is almost purely about the wire syntax, and the way the API represents things.</p>

<p>
Existing Resource designs are unaffected, except in one regard:</p>

<p>
Since bundles are now resources, a Reference(Any) could now potentially reference a document rather than a specific resource. We've identified this technical possibility, but not performed any serious analysis of whether this would be a good or a bad idea.</p>

<p>
Unless you work with the API directly (as opposed to just being concerned with the contents of the resources), you don't need to worry about the impact of this change other than the ""reference to a document"" question</p>

<p>
This is (pretty obviously) a big breaking change to the API. For my server, I maintain a single server source with conditional compiles for DSTU1 and the current version, and I don't know whether I'll be able to make that work after this change.</p>

<p>
The size of this change has been a factor - we've said we'll make changes where they're justified, but this is a BIG one. So the benefits have to be big. I've become persuaded that this is worth doing (we've made many other breaking changes, so the mere fact it's a breaking change isn't a problem per se, but the size of this is a factor) for the following reasons:</p>

<p>
It makes life simpler for implementers</p>

<p>
It's more capable of solving future problems (we need to invest a lot of work in query flexibility, and I kept tripping over Atom restrictions in planning this)</p>

<p>
It's easier to document</p>

<p>
It aligns better with other specifications (e.g. SCIM, oData, other RESTful APIs)</p>

<p>
We're making this in response to implementer experience in the real world</p>

<p>
<br />
 </p>

<p>
Open Issues</p>

<p>
There's still a few things that this proposal doesn't solve:</p>

<p>
This proposed redesign doesn't settle the question of intrinsic vs extrinsic security labels (still an open issue)</p>

<p>
It may be that we define specific subclasses of bundle for specific uses - the 5 uses we know of have different rules - but they are also highly overlapping, so we haven't yet made a decision on that (but you still have to be able to tell them apart, whatever we do)</p>

While some operation parameters are optional, it is not clear whether it is acceptable for a server to ignore those parameters (or for that matter, to ignore required parameters), nor whether it's necessary to communicate in some fashion that parameters have been ignored.  This is particularly important when looking at forward compatibility when new optional parameters might be introduced that won't be supported by older servers.</p>

Using the FHIR DateTime data type for birth date and birth time adds in complexity of time zone handling as there's an expectation that if there are hours/minutes specified, a Time Zone should also be included.</p>

<p>
While most systems have a birth date for a patient, most systems do not have a birth time for a patient or don't have a strong use case for producing/consuming birth information with time zone considerations included.</p>

<p>
Unlike other timestamps, a person's birth date/time is something that would not typically be qualified with time zone information. For example, if a person is born at 11:00 PM in New York City on 11/30/1953, no system is going to record/capture this as 0400 12/1/1953 UTC.</p>

<p>
Also, the patient in question will always refer to his/her birth date as 11/30.</p>

<p>
I would propose one of the two paths forward:</p>

<p>
1. change birthDate to have a data type of ""date"". Then, implementers with a need for birthTime could add this in via an extension to include birthTime</p>

<p>
2. change birthDate to have a data type of ""date"" and incldue birthTime as part of the standard.</p>

<p>
Personal preference would be #1 but would like to discuss with PA group. We should also discuss deathDate to see if has similar considerations.</p>

Presently, a resource logical id is allowed to be 1-36 characters, a..z, '-', and '.'. The intent is to allow a variety of id schemes including OID and UUID. A key point is that the id is limited in length, since this must be indexed, and matching is always exact. </p>

<p>
There's a couple of issues with this:<br />
- 36 chars is not long enough for some OIDs, and some complex id generation schemes (sometimes required for composite identifiers where systems are mapping concepts into FHIR)<br />
- we say somewhere that A..Z is allowed, but don't allow this<br />
 </p>

<p>
Also, the change to the bundle/resource format has resulted in additional validation and many existing identiifers in the spec weren't valid. For now, I have adjusted the publication tooling to use the regex ''[A-Za-z0-9\-\.]{1,64}'. We should determine what it should be, and fix up resource identities to conform to it.</p>

The value set no-immunization-reason contains various reasons for not giving an immunization, including but not limited to refusal. The name of the element, refusalReason, is therefore misleading, since the reasons are broader: e.g., the patient might be immune due to prior exposure, or the vaccine was simply out of stock. I suggest two changes: (1) change ""refusedIndicator"" to ""notGivenIndicator"" and (2) change ""refusalReason"" to ""notGivenReason"".  If this isn't acceptable, then the value set for refusal reason should include only refusal reasons, not other types of exemptions.</p>

A related issue is that there are no invariants that prevent (e.g.) having a refusal reason when the vaccine wasn't refused, or documenting an adverse reaction when the vaccine was not administered. </p>

When selecting a tab, quite often the next logical action is to want to scroll down to see more of the XML, JSON or other view.  Unfortunately, when you select the tab, the tab has focus and the down arrow causes navigation of the tabs rather than navigation of the content within a tab.  What would be best is if selecting a tab automatically brought focus to the tab content.  (Even better would be if left-right arrow moved between tabs, though that might not work as well for small displays where horizontal scrolling might be needed as well.)</p>

There has been a recent change to profile list from a given resource to allow for a group of profiles which is reasonable.</p>

<p>
However, for the simple case where one name/id maps to a single profile the profile group page should be skipped and the resource package (profile) linked directly to the detailed profile page. Isn't very useful for a user to jump to a page with only a single link to another page with the content they want. Users hate unnecessary mouse  clicks to get to where they want to go to.</p>

<p>
Navigation Example:</p>

<p>
Starting at <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/condition-packages.html"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/condition-packages.html</a></p>

<p>
Would expect clicking on “<a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/cqf-condition-refuted.html"">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) Condition Refuted Profile</a>” would take me to the refuted profile page not the new grouped page (i.e. cqf-condition.html) so the target link here should rather be to <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/cqf-condition-refuted-cqf-condition-refuted.html"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/cqf-condition-refuted-cqf-condition-refuted.html</a></p>

<p>
Having only a single profile with a unique name/id would be the typical case and having a group of profiles with the same logical name will probably be the exception so the desired navigation can be optimized to jump to a group page only with a group exists and the profile if no group exists.</p>

When you delete: do you mark all versions as deleted, or do you only delete the current version leaving the previous as active? -- I expect the former but can't judge based on the spec.</p>

I recently ran into problems representing certain medication frequencies in the current FHIR Timing structure.  Specifically, frequencies that have both a duration and a width (“Every 21 days for 1 hour”, which is used in chemo infusions) or that have a range (“Every 4-6 hours”) can’t be represented in the current FHIR Timing.repeat structure.  I would like to propose the following revisions to Timing.repeat to address these issues:</p>

<p>
• Add “periodWidth” (decimal)</p>

<p>
• Rename “units” to be “periodUnit”</p>

<p>
• Add “durationUnit” (UCUM code, as with periodUnits)</p>

<p>
• Add “rangeMax” (decimal).  Definition: “the maximum value for a range that when present and non-zero would represent the inclusive upper bound where the inclusive lower-bound would be either the frequency or the periodWidth”, whichever was not 1.</p>

<p>
• Add a rule that either frequency or periodWidth must be 1</p>

<p>
Using these attributes with the existing frequency and duration attributes, you would be able to represent some common frequencies as follows:</p>

<p>
(F=frequency, W=periodWidth, U=periodUnit, M=rangeMax, D=duration, DU=durationUnit)</p>

<p>
• Every 8 hours:                                        F:1,W:8,U:h</p>

<p>
• Every 7 days                                            F:1,W:7,U:d</p>

<p>
• 3 times a day                                           F:3,W:1,U:d</p>

<p>
• Every 4-6 hours                                      F:1,W:4,U:h,M:6</p>

<p>
• Every 21 days for 1 hour                     F:1,W:21,U:d,D:1,DU:h</p>

<p>
• Three times a week for ½ hour       F:3,W: 1,U:wk,D:0.5,DU:h</p>

<p>
Another change I would prefer, but which is not necessary to fix this problem is to change ""frequency"" to ""period"".  I think this would be more intuitive for implementers.</p>

In our use, we have found that with Legacy system integration, sometimes we need to obtain the display text for the source coding system/value as it was not present in the original system.

I have been reviewing the Terminology additions proposed for DSTU 2. Specifically I have been looking at <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/conceptmap-operations.html#translate"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/conceptmap-operations.html#translate</a>.</p>

<p>
We have a use case with the US DoD and VA where we receive a lot of codings in the US DoD and VA local codes in their legacy repositories. We have to bulk translate these to national standards. We augmented the Terminology Server in use at these facilities to include a bulk translation mechanism that allows us to pass a series of pairs where you specify the source systems, code and value to translate and the destination coding system to translate to. The function returns an array of the pairs with the translated data.</p>

<p>
We did this because the terminology server is in a different network location than our proposed clinical FHIR server endpoints to legacy systems and we wanted to remove the network latency of all those translate calls.</p>

<p>
Is there any thought to adding a batch processing capability to translate? This does not seem to be covered by extension methods on operations as the original translate parameters won't apply.</p>

<p>
From Lloyd...</p>

<p>
We just added a batch mode validation operation.  A batch mode translation operation would be reasonable too.  Would you want to do it against a single concept map or would you specify a separate concept map per coding?  In any event, submit a change request.</p>

<p>
Answer:</p>

<p>
We implemented a general purpose set of parameters that would allow you to specify different coding system targets for each code you want to translate. Therefore, we would like to be able to specify the code system to translate to for each source system coding in the batch.</p>

If I send a patient with one name and you have 3 names, you're not required to get rid of your extra names.  This is normal practice in the v2 messaging space.  However, in v2, there's the ability to use ""null"" to explicitly remove a particular occurrence.  In FHIR, we have no equivalent mechanism to control this.  As well, while this behavior is common in messaging, it's going to be more surprising in the RESTful space.  We need to define *exactly* what expectations client systems should have and what the appropriate mechanisms are to have control over what happens on the server.</p>

Enhancement request: There should be a way to profile a profile.</p>

<p>
Background: Currently, only core resources can be profiled. That means that profiles cannot build on one another, for example, by incorporating extensions already defined by an existing profile, and adding another extension in addition to the existing ones. The only way to do this at the present time is to bulk-copy a profile and modify it. However, the bulk copying method doesn't allow changes to the first profile propagate to the derived profile, in the same way that (currently) changes to a base resource affect a profile of that resource.</p>

<p>
Use cases: (1) Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) wants to adopt all the extensions and terminology bindings defined by Data Access Framework (DAF), and stay in synch with DAF as DAF changes in the future. However, DAF is quite extensive and it would be a maintenance headache to essentially create a fork by bulk-copying the DAF profiles to use as the basis for CQF profiles.  (2) Users of CQF may add their own extensions to the CQF profiles. It would be a headache to have to copy the CQF profile and modify the copy, rather than simply profiling the existing CQF profile.</p>

<p>
Suggested change: Extend the tooling to allow a profile to give the name of a profile (not just the name of a resource) as its basis.</p>

"===",3873,3,"2014-12-16 08:39:13+00","","Explicitly specify resource/element types throughout?","<p>
There are implicit rules at play when it comes to determining the types of elements. A profile specifies a resource (e.g. alert.profile.json) unless it is a type (e.g. base64Binary.profile.json) or a sub-profile (e.g. Age.profile.json). The latter two both define ""base"", so you know it's something other than a Resource, while the first doesn't and is thus inferred to be a resource.</p>

<p>
Inline-defined backbone elements on the other hand do not specify a base or type either, but are assumed to be elements, not full resources (e.g. Alert.meta). Types, like base64Binary, however still do specify their type as ""code: Element"".</p>

<p>
Granted those are not difficult to grasp, but would it make sense to be explicit and always specify ""base"" at the profile's root and/or ""type [ code: Resource]"", unless the element is an Element?</p>

Capturing alter in code is much desired than capturing it in text (which certainly has a good value too). But if we change the type of Alert.note from string to CodeableConcept, it will satisfy the both use cases and flexible enough to drive the use towards code wherever and whenever possible. Applications which can not support narrative alter can fill in CodeableConcept.text, and applications supporting coded alert can use CodeableConcept.coding. Since the cardinality of this element is 1..1, either text or code or both will be reinforced.</p>

Hello</p>

<p>
This item is to suggest addition of the following optional fields to the core MedicationStatement resource:</p>

<p>
<strong>1. MedicationStatement.reasonForUse</strong> (String | Codeable Concept | Condition) - this would describe why the medication is being taken and may be coded.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. MedicationStatement.instructions</strong> (String): this would describe the instructions the patient follows for taking the medication. Note, this may be provided separate and/or additional information to what is contained in the MedicationStatement.dosage fields.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. MedicationStatement.notes</strong> (String): this would allow the author of a MedicationStatement to adding supporting free text related to the statement.</p>

<p>
<strong>Justification</strong>:</p>

<p>
Inclusion of these fields would lead to a more broadly useful Medication Statement resource and promote better reuse of data and analytics (in particular a coded reasonForUse). Further, many existing Medication List applications and clinical documents use some or all of these fields. Here are a few examples from existing consumer and provider applications.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Medication Statements in existing consumer applications:</strong></p>

<p>
Fields such as these are broadly supported by a number of online and mobile consumer medication lists applications. For example:</p>

<p>
a) Drugs.com (<a href=""http://www.drugs.com/"">http://www.drugs.com</a>) supports a <em>For</em> (reasonForUse) field which may be coded to include a condition. When a coded <em>For</em> value is chosen, this information is then reused by the system to populate the set of Conditions for the patient. Further a <em>Comments</em> (notes) field allows a consumer to provide additional notes. A number of screenshots attached demonstrate this functionality. </p>

<p>
b) The NPS MedicineWise consumer medications list smartphone application (<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/medicinelist+/id777483494?mt=8"">https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/medicinelist+/id777483494?mt=8</a>) allows consumers to maintain a medications list on their Apple iOS or Android smartphone - see attached screenshots. When adding medications, the user may enter a <em>Condition</em> (reasonForUse), and may also enter a <em>Note</em> (notes) for each medication.</p>

<p>
c) The Australian National Health Record (the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record or PCEHR) allows consumers to create and associate with their record a Consumer Entered Health Summary clinical document (see: <a href=""https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/personal-health-summary"">https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/personal-health-summary</a>) . The content of this document is fundamentally two lists - a Medication list and an Adverse Reaction list. Amongst the fields associated with each medication in the medication list are <em>Directions</em> (instructions), <em>Clinical Indication</em> (reasonForUse), and <em>Comments</em> (notes). See attached information model screenshot.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Medication Statements in existing clinical applications:</strong></p>

<p>
Medication Statements contained in Medication Lists created by clinicians frequently contain these fields as well. The following examples are from Australian national clinical document specifications and are used in the PCEHR.</p>

<p>
a) Discharge Summary (<a href=""https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/discharge-summary"">https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/discharge-summary</a>)</p>

<p>
The Discharge Summary specification contains two lists of medications - one for Current Medications on Discharge and another for Ceased Medications - see attached information model screenshot. The Current Medications on Discharge list contains medications with fields for <em>Reason for Therapeutic Good</em> (<em>reasonForUse)</em>, <em>Additional Comments</em> (<em>note)</em>, and <em>Dose Instruction</em> (<em>instructionsForUse). </em></p>

<p>
b) Shared Health Summary (<a href=""https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/EP-1752-2014"">https://www.nehta.gov.au/implementation-resources/clinical-documents/EP-1752-2014</a>)</p>

<p>
The Shared Health Summary specification defines a clinician authored health summary for an individual to be shared in the national health record. Amongst the fields in the Shared Health Summary is a list of Known Medications - see attached information model screenshot. For each Known Medication, fields exist for <em>Directions</em> (instructions), <em>Clinical Indication</em> (reasonForUse), and <em>Comment</em> (notes).</p>

<u><strong>Problem Statement</strong></u></p>

<p>
After downloading the current development version of the Java Reference Implemenation; link: <a href=""http://hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/FHIR-Develop/fhir-0.4.0-Java-0.9.zip"">fhir-0.4.0-Java-0.9.zip</a>, I found that I was not able to successfully compile the extracted source code files.  The compilation errors all pointed to missing classes.  For example:</p>

<p>
<em>""The import org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.annotations.Block cannot be resolved""</em></p>

<p>
Examination of the zip archive revealed that the Java package ""org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.annotations"" was not included in the archive.</p>

<p>
<u><strong>Corrective Action</strong></u></p>

<p>
I traced the cause of the missing Java package in the fhir /build/tools/java source code to the JavaGenerator class.  Complete SVN path:</p>

<p>
<em><a href=""http://gforge.hl7.org/svn/fhir/trunk/build/tools/java/org.hl7.fhir.tools.core/src/org/hl7/fhir/tools/implementations/java/JavaGenerator.java"">http://gforge.hl7.org/svn/fhir/trunk/build/tools/java/org.hl7.fhir.tools.core/src/org/hl7/fhir/tools/implementations/java/JavaGenerator.java</a></em></p>

<p>
The generate() method logic that adds the required files to the Java zip file was missing the statement needed to add the files for the annotations package.  So, I added the following statement at line 198.  After which my local build process now produces the Java RI zip with the required annotations folder and files.</p>

<p>
<em>zip.addFiles(implDir+""org.hl7.fhir.instance""+sl+""src""+ sl+""org""+sl+""hl7""+sl+""fhir""+sl+""instance""+sl+""model""+sl+""annotations""+sl, ""org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/annotations/"", "".java"", null);</em></p>

At present, the delete operation says:</p>

<p>
If the resource cannot be deleted because it does not exist on the server, the server SHALL return 404 (Not found). Performing this interaction on a resource that is already deleted has no effect, and should return 204</p>

<p>
This is problematic for several reasons:</p>

<p>
* It's not idempotent - delete should success if the outcome is that the resource doesn't exist<br />
* what happens when the user isn't allowed to see the resource?<br />
* what about systems that don't track deleted resources?</p>

<p>
Better to  just return 204 if the resource doesn't exist after the operation. </p>

<p>
* add an invariant that Bundle.entry.status must be missing if  Bundle.entry.deleted is present<br />

<p>From a server standpoint, a system is likely to have more than just one address. Also, attempting a match/filter a set of patient records based on street address lines is something that is unlikely to be supported. Lastly, when used in a search, address information is typically always referring to a patient's usual residence so it would be helpful if the specification made this clear in some way.</p>

<p>Suggestion: break out any address related search parameters to be more specific. etc. Include 1 or 2 of the most common items that might be included in a patient search and then allow individual implementations to add in any additional search parameters. e.g. instead of ""address"" have e.g. homeCity, homePostalCode.</p>

For normal cases of token search, I can assume system and code on the same element/node of the resource, but not on ValueSet.<br />
For token search, I would expect a 1-to-1 match, but I apparently need to look up every system first to see if it happens to be case-insensitive and adjust my search accordingly. Here I'm looking at ValueSet.define anyway so I already have the object, but in other object searches like Observations I might not.</p>

<p>
- Can a server just skip support for caseSensitive in its implementation? I understand there are case insensitive systems out there, but just like systems with white space in their codings I would like to be able to choose to declare those unsupported.</p>

<p>
- Also ValueSet?system=X&amp;code=Y and ValueSet?code=X|Y seem to be overlapping. Is one preferred over the other? Both valid?</p>

<p>
----</p>

<p>
I realize there were actually multiple questions in one here: this ticket is about adding clarification to the search parameter code with regards to case sensitivity (and maybe to token on the search page as well - tokens are not defined to be case sensitive, but I would expect them to be). </p>

The new JSON syntax, FAQ #1 is:</p>

<p>
-------------------</p>

<p>
I have to initialize superclasses first, so by the time I'm done with my base class, which handles (modifier) extensions, I don't yet know which keys are regular properties and which are extensions. I could solve it by keeping a list of property names in exach class, which would be in addition to having them inside the initializers, but that's not quite nice. Swift currently has almost no reflection capabilities, so there will be a third place to hold hardcoded property names when serialization is done.<br /><br />
So deciding between having a property name list or use XML. Unless – are extensions required to start with ""http://"" or ""https://""? Digging...</p>

<p>
------------------</p>

<p>
or a variant of this question</p>

<p>
Here's the answer</p>

<p>
-------</p>

<p>
There are 2 cases:</p>

<p>
1. You are in a defined FHIR class:<br />
 - any extensions have a "":"" in them<br />
- any normal fields don't</p>

<p>
2. you are in an extension<br />
- either it has 'value[x]'<br />
- or it's another extension:<br />
  -- "":' means separately defined extension<br />
  -- no "":"" means it's a nested extension defined in the same definition<br /><br />
--------------------<br />
this rule is not documented - it has to be derived, so we should state it explicitly</p>

Presently, Procedure.followUp is a 0..1 string.  we suggest changing this to a 0..* CodeableConcept.</p>

Rationale:</p>

<p>
In the interest of enabling decision support and analytics, coded, structured data should be considered wherever appropriate and practical. In this case, it seems reasonable to use a set of codes for commonly required follow ups. For example, the example in the spec is ""removal of sutures"". SNOMED has a code for this (Removal of suture (procedure) SCTID: 30549001). In the event that a code is not available for the desired follow up instruction, the text portion of the CodeableConcept can be used.</p>

Presently, Procedure.outcome is a 0..1 string.  We suggest changing this to a 0..1 CodeableConcept.</p>

<p>
Rationale:</p>

<p>
In the interest of enabling decision support and analytics, coded, structured data should be promoted wherever appropriate and practical. In this case, it seems reasonable to use a set of codes for common outcomes. As a suggestion, the set may be three select values under SNOMED's <strong>Modifier mainly for procedure (qualifier value) </strong><strong>SCTID: 106239005</strong>:</p>

<p>
<strong>Successful (qualifier value) SCTID: 385669000</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Partially successful (qualifier value) SCTID: 385670004</strong></p>

<p>
Codes for finer-grained outcomes could also likely be found.</p>

<p>
If more detailed and uncodeable information about the outcome is needed, it could either be put in the text portion of the CodeableConcept or in a Procdure.note. Guiding users toward the latter is preferred, since it would lead to more consistent use of Procedure.outcome.</p>

<p>
This rationale for using CodeableConcepts seems to have been followed already for Procedure.complication, which is already a 0..* CodeableConcept.</p>

In DSTU1, JSON object mappers such as Jackson or Moxy can easily be used to map java beans where the extensions are easily stored in the extension property of a java bean, defined as an array of ""url"" and ""value"" properties.  In the proposed changes, that is no longer the case, to generically represent extenstions one would need to directly parse JSON and extract the extension information and repackage it.  While this proposed representation may be more compact, it makes implmenentation much more difficult.</p>

<p>
Additional testing revealed that this same exception is thrown when parsing any resource with contained resource(s) when the XML is formatted in this compressed manner.</p>

<p>
<u><strong>Corrective Action</strong></u></p>

<p>
The org.hl7.fhir.instance.formats.XMLParseBase class contains two methods for parsing contained resources:</p>

<p>
parseDomainResourceContained(XmlPullParser xpp)<br />
parseResourceContained(XmlPullParser xpp)</p>

<p>
Each of these methods were found to exhibit the same issue where after the return of the parsed DomainResource or Resource when the XML format did not contain any white space caracters, the XmlPullParser current tag was not set properly. The issue is that returned tag position from the parsed DomainResource or Resource was one more tag ahead. This meant that the subsequent second call to next(xpp) was then one more tag position ahead of where it should have been and, therefore, caused the entire Bundle parse to fail.</p>

<p>
I implemented the following code change in my local environment to both of the above methods (shown here in just the parseResourceContained method). The doSecondNext boolean is set based on the XmlPullParser current text immediately following the return of the parsed DomainResource or Resource where the text is expected to not contain the &lt;/resource&gt; end tag in order for the second next(xpp) to be called.</p>

<p>
<u>Code example</u><br />
  protected Resource parseResourceContained(XmlPullParser xpp) throws Exception {<br />
    next(xpp);<br />
    int eventType = nextNoWhitespace(xpp);<br />
    if (eventType == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) {<br />
      Resource r = (Resource) parseResource(xpp);<br />
      boolean doSecondNext = (xpp.getText() != null &amp;&amp; xpp.getText().indexOf(""resource"") &lt; 0) ? true : false;<br />
      next(xpp);<br />
      if (doSecondNext) {<br />
        xpp.next();<br />
      }<br />
      return r;<br />
    } else {<br />
      unknownContent(xpp);<br />
      return null;<br />
    }<br />

Wellness doesn't feel like a condition/diagnosis/problem, per se, but I don't see another element available that scopes the care plan.

By the definition in FHIR spec ""Differential statements describe only the <strong>differences </strong>that they make relative to another profile (which is most often the base FHIR resource or data type)"".</p>

<p>
Source: <a href=""https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/profiling.html#2.11.0.5"">https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/profiling.html#2.11.0.5</a></p>

<p>
The current tooling seems to contradict this statement in that many of the same definitions are repeated in the differential section. If the type or cardinality of a particular element in a profile is the same as that of the base resource then it should not be present in the differential for that element in the profile but still appears.</p>

<p>
Example: (cqf-substance):</p>

<p>
  &lt;snapshot&gt;<br />
   &lt;element&gt;<br />
      &lt;path value=""Substance.type""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;short value=""...""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;formal value=""...""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;comments value=""...""/&gt;<br /><strong>      &lt;min value=""1""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;max value=""1""/&gt;</strong><br /><strong>      &lt;type&gt;<br />
        &lt;code value=""CodeableConcept""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;/type&gt;<br />
      &lt;mustSupport value=""true""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;isSummary value=""false""/&gt;</strong><br />
      &lt;binding&gt;...&lt;/binding&gt;<br />
    &lt;/element&gt;<br />
&lt;/snapshot&gt;</p>

<p>
&lt;differential&gt;<br />
  &lt;element&gt;<br />
      &lt;path value=""Substance.type""/&gt;<br />
   <strong>   &lt;min value=""1""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;max value=""1""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;type&gt;<br />
        &lt;code value=""CodeableConcept""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;/type&gt;</strong><br /><strong>      &lt;mustSupport value=""true""/&gt;<br />
      &lt;isSummary value=""false""/&gt;</strong><br />
    &lt;/element&gt;<br />
&lt;/differential&gt;</p>

<p>
The FHIR tooling should suppress adding the type and cardinality (Iikewise mustSupport + isSummary) if it is the same of the base resource/profile to keep the profiles with only the actual differences between the profiles and its base.</p>

<p>
The only difference in profile should be changing this to the MustSupport value of true and the desired differential for ""Substance.type"" element should be following:</p>

<p>
&lt;differential&gt;<br />
  &lt;element&gt;<br />
      &lt;path value=""Substance.type""/&gt;<br /><strong>      &lt;mustSupport value=""true""/&gt;</strong><br />

If a document is sent with a single resource and then updated to remove the item, a list will need to be utilized to indicate the emptyReason. If a document is sent with a single item, and then updated to add additional items, a list will need to be used to enable the processing. This optionality serves no beneficial purpose and can be eliminated by simply extending the section to support text like CDA.

A clinical document needs to exhibit a high degree of consistency with the view of the information that the legal authenticator reviewed when they signed the document. In CDA the section/text element was identified as the location for the authenticated narrative content. In FHIR narrative can be found in any domain resource, inclusive of the List resource.

Narrative only sections can be created by setting Content to a resource of the appropriate type and only populating the narrative portion of the resource. If the meaning of the section is such that an appropriate resource does not exist, the Other resource should be used.

If a narrative note is created via dictation and then later transcribed. The current modeling for a FHIR document would place the narrative text in a subordinate resource, likely the ""Other"" resource, or a List which contains a set of resources. If the narrative content of the document is processed via NLP software, it is really hard to know how the dictated content would be preserved intact, if any additional resources were generated from the NLP process. Without a clear separation of narrative content and machine processable resources, processes which adds discrete content to a document would likely impact its narrative.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

The FHIR document model presumes that the parts (resources) in a document can be removed safely from a document. This may be true for structured data, e.g. ""CCD"", which was extracted from an EMR, however for narrative documents, authored by physicians and authenticated, the whole is the only safe unit of consumption.

A number of FHIR resources can be represented as Documents (compositions), but are represented as specifically designed static information structures.<br /><br />
Examples are: Care Plan, Family History, Diagnostic Report, and various billing claim forms.<br /><br />
This presents a interesting challenge to implementers, do you use a general model or a specific model?<br /><br />
I think there is an underlying architectural issue that needs to be considered as more and more resources are developed.<br /><br />
HL7 V2.x did not create these kinds of specialized structures, however V3 did and as a result created +1,000 schemas.

Need to add language about FHIR support for SAIF.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
The current FHIR modeling space does not speak of the need to create conceptual and logical models, prior to the construction of an implementation model. As a result, domain modeling in FHIR generates implementation models.<br /><br />
We see this result in the Care Plans and possibly in the Billing Claim modeling. As the modeling takes place somewhere, but is not formally identified, there is no traceability present.<br /><br />

The Billing and Claims modeling is being reviewed. The WG had strong views of how the resources should be, so the FMG agreed to let them proceed on that basis to give the community something to review, but it won't necessarily stay that way. CarePlan has two variants to solicit feedback on implementer preference. It is not clear what formal set of statements and documentation is desired. V3 mappings are already formally provided in the mappings tabs. Can you clarify what is required?<br /><br />

Certain relationships between resources in FHIR are not defined. For instance, both the ProcedureRequest and Procedure resources pertain to a Procedure. Also a DiagnosticOrder and a ProcedureRequest both pertain to the notion of a 'Request'. The definitions of such relations in FHIR are important. At this time, some of this is done by categorization.

The Quantity type allows a Comparator, which turns the Quantity into a QuantityInterval with unspecified boundaries. The comparator property fundamentally changes the nature and semantics of Quantity. In order to capture the proposed semantics, we recommend that a different approach be taken, one based on a quantity range that represents an open interval.<br /><br />
The problem is that when dealing with Quantities in a reasoning context, the execution environment must always deal with the possibility that the Quantity isn't a specific quantity, but rather a range of quantities with a boundary on one side only if this attribute is filled.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Well, it's not a range either; its a single value whose value has a known bound. If you're going to reason, you'll have to reason between that differences too. And it just moves the pain around, if you make every quantity a choice between Quantity and QuantityBoundedValue (and many of them will be). Definitely deck chairs on the titanic.

A profile extending another profile/resource must define a parent base and a differential section that defines the extension (optionally with the snapshot element). This makes sense.<br /><br />
However, the differential for core resource profiles (e.g. Immunization, Procedure, etc.) is entirely duplicating the snapshot element. This is mostly an artifact of the profile generation and publishing tools rather than the FHIR spec but the spec (e.g. profile section 6.17) should clearly differentiate between top-level profiles (those with no base) and those with a base.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Is-Modifier is a boolean property that is assigned when an element is defined, either as part of the base resource contents in this specification, or when extensions are defined. An element is labeled ""Is-Modifier = true"" if the value it contains may change the interpretation of the element that contains it (including if the element is the resource as a whole). Typical examples of elements that are labeled ""Is-Modifier"" are elements such as ""status"", ""active"", ""refuted"", or ""certainty"". Whether an element is a modifier cannot be changed when element usage is described in a Resource Profile. When an element is labeled as Is-Modifier, the documentation must be clear about why it is a modifier.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
Is-Modifier is too coarse-grained to be of much use. Some attribute values change the semantics, and some do not. For example, if the element is ""wasCancelled"" then true is the modifying value, and false is not modifying. If the element is status, then there might be several status values that are not modifying (e.g. active, completed, in progress) and some that are (e.g. entered in error, cancelled). Instead of labeling the element as a modifier, that modifier label should be applied to values. That way, the receiver can quickly scan a resource and know if the meaning is actually being modified, even if the receiver does not understand the nature of the specific modification. This will result in less data being potentially lost, simply because there is a modifying element. Under the proposed change, the data receiver can process a resource without having prior knowledge of each possible modifier.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Well, we could do that; it would be an extra layer of complexity and there are co-occurance cases. It's really just a flag to implementers to be careful and check for values they don't understand in these fields. I think that whitelisting by the implementer is better than bloacklisting by HL7. I suspect committees will agree.<br /><br /><strong>Disposition</strong>:<br />
Not Persuasive<br /><br /><strong>Disposition Comment</strong>:<br />
The purpose of ""isModifier"" is to indicate that the element cannot be safely ignored. ""active"" and ""cancelled"" are both 'modifying' in that a value of 'active' causes elements to be interpreted differently than a value of 'cancelled'. There is no default semantic to the other elements in the resource.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Modifying attributes modify meaning in a finite number of predictable ways. For example, ""entered in error"" nullifies the resource and says the resource should not be considered for clinical purposes. Other elements and values reverse the meaning of the resource, such as ""did not occur"" or ""refuted."" Still others change the mode of a resource, for example, when the status is proposed or planned. Other values do not actually modify the semantics of the resource at all, but simply qualify the meaning (e.g. in-progress | completed or provisional | working | confirmed). Currently, no semantics are attached to modifying values. It would be much more powerful and computable if the values of a modifying attribute were marked as non-modifying, nullifying, negating, or mode-altering. Then a system processing the resource would know immediately what change of meaning (if any) was happening to the resource. Such meta-data concerning a modifying value could be quite powerful in search; for example, a search could exclude all negated resources without necessarily having to delve into the specific negating values on a resource-by-resource basis.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

The primary purpose of isModifier is simply to flag elements as ""not safe to ignore if unrecognized"". More sophisticated understanding of the various ways in which modification could occur (which is completely unconstrained and likely unenumerable) is not part of core.

Some resources have nullifiers and some do not, and there is no rationale why some do and some don't. For example, an Observation can be ""entered in error"" but a MedicationStatement cannot, a MedicationPrescription can, but a Immunization cannot, and so on. Either all resources should allow for a nullifying attribute, or none should. If the former, there should be a standard attribute to indicate nullification of the resource. The existence of a standard nullification element across all resources will greatly simplify search and processing.

Presently, committees add these if they make sense in the domain. For many resources, a concept like this doesn't make sense. And so I would be against adding this to every resource.

Having a standard way to negate resources would be extremely valuable. Negation (i.e. saying something has not been done or not been observed) is quite frequently encountered in FHIR, although how it is achieved is different in every resource. Sometimes, this is indicated by certain value(s) of a status element, and sometimes there are specific elements such as ""wasNotGiven."" Some resources that arguably should have negation possibility (e.g. Procedure) do not have a negation attribute. There is no consistency in how negation is handled across FHIR. Since negation is something that can occur for almost any action or observation (including Procedure), it would be useful to make this a general property or feature. If the method for indicating negation could be made consistent across FHIR, many things would become simpler and more transparent; for example, one could have a general search pattern to find exclude negated resources.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Negation is introduced into core when it is ""part of the 80%"". I.e. When most systems typically capture negated instances as part of the same structure the use to capture non-negated instances. For places where this does not fall into the 80%, this is handled using extensions. If you feel the assertion of the 80% is not correct, then identify specific instances with evidence of broad existing implementer support.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Resources are things, and things can have states. If there are rules in FHIR for when an stateful thing should be a resource, versus when that stateful thing should be a resource with a status value, they are not clear. In FHIR, an order for a thing is often a resource (NutritionOrder, DiagnosticOrder), and a request for thing is sometimes a resource (CommunicationRequest, ProcedureRequest). However, many resources have status values like ""requested"" and ""proposed"" and ""planned"" which could easily be ""promoted"" to resources (e.g. CommunicationProposal, ProcedurePlan, ProcedureProposal) to be more like DiagnosticOrder. On the other hand, resources like ProcedureRequest could easily be ""demoted"" to status values (e.g. Procedure with status=requested). There does not seem to be a consistent dividing line between when something is a resource, and when it is a status. It would be desirable to have consistent rules so there is no ambiguity between a lifecycle stage and a resource.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />
Yes<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
well, ok, but you assume that clinical practice and understanding is consistent, which is often not the case. In FHIR, we prefer consistency with the domain over internal consistency, but that doesn't mean that we can create inconsistency for no reason. I think it's one thing to have a status for various aspects of future, vs a status code that crosses into the past. This frequently modulates all the definitions of every field, and often they are incompatible. Are there any cases where status cross the future/past boundary? if there is, I haen't noticed them. So I don't see design inconsistency here, but there is inconsistency around planning; this is already an open issue that is the subject of further work<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

I think that this is consistent, but PC could make things easier by calling it ""a procedure perfomed for diagnostic reasons"". Still, the grey zone is difficult in real life; in some cases, the procedure is implied (e.g. phlebotomy) and in other cases, the diagnostic service is implied (e.g. in research labs). Usually, the diagnostic order is explicit for billing purposes. Given that this is a real world ambiguity, I'm not sure how much we can do about it<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

When one builds a profile programmatically, one can enter extensions and elements in any order. The generated XML appears to reflect that order. However, Lloyd mentioned that when building profiles, one must be sure to place extension elements first and then other elements in the same order they appear in the core resource. Doing so places a heavy burden on implementers. I would suggest that the reference implementation orders the attribute as they should be ordered without requiring the developer to order them as that order is already known.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

The FHIR model is very accessible and easy to grasp which makes it appealing. However, as the above comments reveal, there are a number of inconsistencies in FHIR across resources. As CDS/CQI is increasingly moving towards the core FHIR model as its own logical model, it is important that FHIR achieve stronger structural and semantic consistency across resources if we are to use FHIR as a computable model. Not doing so requires rule/measure authors to introduce unnecessary variations in artifacts to account for these inconsistencies. I would highly recommend that, prior to the May DSTU publication as resources stabilize, FHIR resources be reviewed holistically for such consistency.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Based on the use case information, the Person resource appears to be designed to solve a problem that is likely shared by many resources. If a system is trying to aggregate data from multiple FHIR servers, they need a way to link equivalent resources together. Is it really appropriate to make Person as a one-off mechanism to do this instead of having a core infrastructure to allow a resource to have a ""link"" to ""related resources"" and/or alternative URLs?<br />

My understanding is that the episodeOfCare is solely a single organization's tracking of an episode. We should make sure that the standard is clear regarding this vs. multiple organizations managing a condition (or set of conditions) for a patient. If the intent is to try to make a standard for how multiple organizations can track periods of responsibility within a patient's episode of care, then I think the design needs much more discussion.<br /><br />

The web-based format is OK for random navigation to a specific topic, but it is weak for reviewing and balloting. It's very difficult to know how big the spec is, how much of it I've covered, and what I have not read yet. Unlike a typical document, there are no ""pages"" and not even a detailed table of contents where I could check sections off as I read them. As I read through the spec and jump from page to page, it's almost impossible to know when I've read all there is to read on a topic. I suggest that future FHIR ballots include a PDF of what is ballotable. If the spec is concise as it claims, then a PDF should not be too voluminous.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
hah. The PDF would be massive (all the supporting stuff) - and we don't even know how to produce it. But there is a linear table of contents - it's the first thing on the documentation page, and from the home page. For exactly this purpose. Don't know what to do to make it more obvious.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Each resource may include a human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human.<br />
Resources SHOULD always contain narrative to support human-consumption as a fallback. However, in a strictly managed trading systems where all systems share a common data model and additional text is unnecessary or even a clinical safety risk, the narrative may be omitted. Implementers should consider carefully before doing this, as it will mean that these resources can only be understood in the limited trading environment. Closed trading partner environments are very likely to open up during the lifetime of the resources they define. In addition, many workflow steps involving finding and aggregating resources are much more difficult or tedious if the resources involved do not have their own text.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
I suggest that resources SHALL contain a narrative (though there needs to be a way to express unknown data, as with CDA). The spec is ambivalent, saying first that a resource ""may"" include narrative, then later saying it SHOULD contain, and saying that no narrative is OK in a ""closed trading partner environment."" If the goal is interoperability as well as usability, why cater to closed environments? The standard should be optimized for the goals of openness and interoperability in the common case, not the edge case. After all, FHIR is premised upon NOT catering to edge cases (e.g., in its data model). Closed environments can use ""closed"" methods of exchange (such as custom messaging or custom services), or could create their own FHIR profile that defaults the narrative (if they really don't want it).<br /><br />
I also see that the Structure for the Narrative has cardinality of 1..1. Doesn't that mean it is required (which I agree with)? Is that inconsistent with the paragraph above that says narrative ""may"" or SHOULD) be included?<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
we cannot get a requirement for all resources to have narrative to pass ballot; too many voters think that there's valid reasons to leave them out. Need to fix the root cardinality on the display- that's wrong and misleading. We don't create structures for edge cases, but we also don't make them illegal either.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

The first sentence and the last seem to be contradictory. If the contained resource inherits from the parent resource, then isn't the subject the same? If so, why does the last sentence say that the meaning of the subject is not necessarily the same? It's worse to have an ""uncertain"" feature (inheritance) than to not have it at all. Why not just say that the subject IS the same unless the contained resource has a specific different subject defined.

Using the Condition resource to record an assertion that a patient doesn't have a particular diagnosis, etc.<br /><br />
#2: This means that implementations are not inherently required to ""support"" a modifier extension in any meaningful way - they may achieve this understanding by rejecting instances that contain this extension. Applications may also be able to ignore a modifier extension if that can know that this is safe to do in its own context, though this would not usually be the case.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
This and several of the other examples in this section are legitimate clinical assertions that need to be made at times. There has been a huge amount of discussion (in CCDA) about how to handle negation (like ""no known allergies"" or ""rule out diagnoses"") and unknown data, and an urgent need for examples. So I think it is important for FHIR to specify not just ""avoid modifier extensions where possible"" but to offer positive guidance on how to represent these cases, which have already proven to be problemmatic in interoperability. While FHIR suggests possible examples to handle it, they are not normative. There needs to be a way for a creator of a FHIR resource to be able to express negation in a standardized way, and for receivers to be required to understand such negation.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

This seems like ""nullFlavors"" in HL7 but the values listed for FHIR (unknown | asked | temp | notasked | masked | unsupported | astext | error"" are not given definitions. Even though several seem equivalent to nullFlavors like UNK, ASKU, etc., it's hard to be sure, or to know the reason for differences. I suggest using the existing nullFlavors. I realize that nullFlavors are not perfect and may change, but at least both FHIR and CDA could point to the same definitions that ought to be used across all HL7, since these are semantics, not technical issues.

Early parts of the page refer to the document having ""fixed"" presentation and 2.4.1 says ""the presentation of the document cannot change."" However, 2.4.1.1 allows for different stylesheets from those specified in the document. Even though it says the specified stylesheets SHOULD be used, that is not a SHALL. So if someone uses a different stylesheet, the presentation of the document might change, which contradicts the earlier statements. So are the earlier statements (""fixed"" and ""cannot change"") incorrect?<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

The list is interesting as much for what it does not include as for what it does include. Typical medical history questionnaires (e.g., the physician office ""new patient clipboard"") asks patients for lists of medications, allergies, problems or symptoms, past surgeries, etc. Those items are not included the example, but they are almost universal (either free form or sometimes check-the-box). Something should be said about why those are omitted from the example and whether the recommendation is to NOT include them. But I have concerns if a questionnaire is not fully represented (e.g., by excluding Medications question), because omission of sections could lose context and harm the Q's integrity. 4.26.5.1 partially discusses this issue, but poses the choice as either/or. Could it be both/and? E.g., the Questionnaire resource could capture an entire questionnaire form, as it was presented, but then the appropriate items can also be placed in other Resources (Medications, Problems, Allergies, etc.) through either human intervention or automated mechanisms if possible.<br />
Thus, I recommend adding ""patient intake questionnaire (clipboard)"" to the list of examples.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

Healthcare Service is very unclear because it is so generic and there is very little description. What is it for? What level of granularity? There need to be some good examples. I presume it is not supposed to be for detailed clinical acts (e.g., tests/observations or procedures) that can be performed there, e.g., Urinalysis or Appendectomy. Is it supposed to be for high level categories of services that an organization might advertise to the public, such as ""Obstetrics"" or ""Neonatal Care?"" Some examples would really be helpful, but there are no meaningful examples in the Examples tab. Until it is clarified, this Resource should not even be in FHIR, as implementers would not know when/how to use it. IF this is a service for which an appointment can be scheduled, shouldn't it be in the ""Scheduling/Ordering"" category?<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

Free text dosage instructions can be used for cases where the instructions are too complex to code. When coded instructions are present, the free text instructions may still be present for display to humans taking or administering the medication.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
As part of ""Dosage Instructions"" there should be some statement of which element relates to what is commonly called ""Sig"" in most prescriptions. There have been difficulties and inconsistencies in how Sig is represented in CCDA, and FHIR should strive to be unambiguous so that usage is correct from the outset. The definition currently says text is used for ""Free text dosage instructions for cases where the instructions are too complex to code."" But this description is inadequate, since even if instructions can be coded, human-readable text is still needed for the patient or person administering the med.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

Significant area where guidance is needed but lacking. The list of examples conspicuously does not mention observations/results from imaging procedures. The Observations template in other HL7 standards (e.g., CCDA) is used for imaging results. The entire page is silent about imaging results/observations, although when it lists ""Laboratory data and other Diagnostic Measures"" it leaves wide open to interpretation what ""other"" might mean (imaging, EKG, etc.). The proposed wording has more explicit and meaningful examples for the ""other diagnostic measures"" and also modifies the next bullet to avoid mentioning vital signs again (since they were in the first bullet).(From looking further into examples for Diagnostic Report in 4.21.7, I see that Imaging results are indeed represented as Observations, thus I strongly recommend mentioning imaging explicitly as an example in 4.20.1)<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

Not clear what ""when the data relates to the patient condition"" means. For instance, if my blood pressure is measured as 130/90 on Dec. 21st at 08:22am, the measurement dtime is clear, but unclear how to say anything, else about when it ""applies"" or ""relates to"" the patient condition. 10 minutes later, 2 hours later, would that latest BP measurement still ""apply?"" I suggest simply deleting the last clause.

What is the distinction between a Diagnostic Report as a resource, vs. a Document bundle that is a diagnostic report? It seems to me that a ""report"" is a document, at least typically. 4.21.4 and 4.21.4.1 reinforce that idea -- they even cite the possibility of presenting the report as a PDF. When should the implementer choose this resource vs. a document?<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
well, if you made it a document, what has all the semantics of the report? I don't understand this confusion, but several people have asked the same question, so evidently something is creating it. Perhaps users have been trained badly in CDA space; to me, it's like asking why there's a difference between the message and the OBR, and which is appropriate to use?<br /><br /><strong>Disposition Comment</strong>:<br />

Note that the Diagnostic Order itself is not a request to perform the investigation - it is just a record of the fact that a request was made. To actually request that a diagnostic procedure be performed, additional workflow beyond simply the existence of a Diagnostic Order is required. This can be achieved by using an Order resource, with the Diagnostic Order referenced from the Order.details, or by using the Diagnostic Order resource in the context of an messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
It is confusing that Order is referenced as a very important Resource that is the actual request for the diagnostic service, yet Order is not listed in 4.0 among the clinical resources list. Rather, if you go down the ""Clinical"" resource list, you can only get to Order if you look at Diagnostic Order and happen to notice this sentence. Order should be elevated to be listed in 4.0 Clinical Resources.<br /><br />
I see that Order is listed in a different category, ""Administrative -- Scheduling/Ordering."" That seems counterintuitive. Wouldn't nearly every clinician think of orders are belonging in their category?<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
if it does, then everything does. Category is not that important. But this does show that clinical users - and lots of other users aside - just don't get the split between order and the domain order resources. This needs wider discussion<br /><br /><strong>Disposition</strong>:<br />

As such an encounter in ""planned"" status is not identical to the appointment that scheduled it, but is the encounter prior to the its actual occurrence, with the expectation that encounter will be updated as it progresses to completion.

A client can determine that an order has not been performed by searching for order resources with no matching responses (see below)<br /><br /><strong>Proposed Wording</strong>:<br />
A client can determine that an order has not been performed by using the Order id to perform a search for Order Response resources that contain a Reference to this Order: if none are found, then there is no record that the order was record (it is possible that the order was performed but the act has not yet been entered into the system).<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
First, ""see below"" does not appear to have text below that explains it.<br />
Second and more significant: ""searching order resources with no matching responses"" does not appear possible based on the Order search parameters. What field can be queried to indicate the existence or absence of responses? There is no response status or reference. My proposed text may resolve the problem, though I'm not sure if that is the correct way to do the query, and it seems like it wouldn't work if the Order id is unvalued (which it can be, given cardinality of 0..1).<br />
Also I added the parenthetical remark because I think it's wise to be cautious about assuming negation (absence of performance) if that has not been asserted.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

The procedure request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures may also be represented by this resource (though this use case is still being discussed and will need to be validated by Patient Care and Orders and Observation).<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
Conflating actual orders entered by practitioners with proposals for orders from CDS does not sound like a good idea. Surely there should be somedistinction between them. If/when the proposal is accepted and an order is actually placed, then the order should be created and the proposal should still remain as a separate entity to preserve the thread of logic that led to the order (and as a safeguard).

The final mode - a changes list, may include deleted items. A typical case is a medication list in a discharge summary, where the list includes items that have been both added and deleted.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
The use of medication list in a discharge summary is not a good example. Typically, the Discharge Summary contains an active list of medications at the time of discharge, is identical to Home Medication List. It does not necessarily include meds that were given in the hospital or that the patient took before being admitted but are not to be continued. It is supposed to be what the patient is supposed to take after discharge. And regardless of whether the discharge meds list includes ""stop medication XXX,"" it is still not a ""changes list"" because some meds may have been on the admission meds list and remain unchanged after discharge. Since those didn't change, they wouldn't be on a changes list, but they have to be included in the discharge meds list. A discharge meds list fits better the definition of ""working"" list mode.<br /><br />
I appreciate the benefit of a ""changes list"" mode, but am having difficulty coming up with a good example.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

The domain committees will work to elevate the extensions into HL7 published extensions or, if adopted by a broad enough portion of the implementer community, into the base resource structure itself. <br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
The first sentence is a promise not necessary to make. Once a resource is normative, can't it still be updated in the future? Every other HL7 standard undergoes changes. So if in the future it makes sense to elevate content from an extension to the core (e.g., because that content has now become part of the ""80% rule""), why rule that out? It is good to consider upgrades and migration and minimizing complexity, but shouldn't the main criterion for core resource content be that it is really the right content for the core, as the core evolves? In fact the sentence later in the section allows for elevation of extensions into the base resource, so the first sentence is contradicted by the latter.R[4]C<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
clarify what extensions might go into core. But these rules relate to backwards compatibility, and aren't going to lightly change<br /><br /><strong>Disposition Comment</strong>:<br />
The rule is in place because we want to commit to implementers that we will not unnecessarily force changes to existing implementations.  If there's already a standard extension for a particular concept and 80% of implementers are uing that extension, we won't want to make them change just because the element now meets some magical criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

The FHIR specification is ""draft"".<br /><br /><strong>Proposed Wording</strong>:<br />
This developmental version of the FHIR specification is ""draft"".<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
I'm confused. What does the existing wording refer to? I can understand that THIS (developmental version of the FHIR spec) is draft, but the sentence saying ""The"" FHIR specification is draft makes me wonder about DSTU 1: isn't it a DSTU, rather than draft? Then two paragraphs later, it says ""This specification has been promoted to DSTU..."" which sounds contradictory with the first sentence. I think it would be best to clarify that THIS (development version) is draft, but that the previously published (0.82) is a DSTU.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

If the dose is expressed as a range, such as 1 - 3, can this be handled with the FHIR MedicationPrescription.dosageInstruction.doseQuantity ?<br /><br />
This is a capability that should be supported. Sometimes Type: Quantity is not sufficient and Type: Range is needed.<br /><br />

It might be a design rule that we have, but even then, I doubt we can make many rules. For instance, on prescription, which field does it undercut?<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

To ease implementations the core data type definition needs to include a clear identifier type. Maintaining an inventory of URIs globally for particular identifier types is unmanageable. Lack of knowledge of the identifier type will restrict identification methods beyond those needed for the most rudimentary, point-to-point integrations.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

Value sets that define their own codes are effectlvely providing inline code system definitions. These are intended for small, simple code systems that are found throughout the implementation context (e.g. lists of wards, status codes, enumerations). <br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
It seems that inline definition is useful in cases where the semantics are significant in a limited scope--i.e., for local values--and that this is the requirement
<br />
that drives their inclusion. If so, this should be explicit. If not, the rationale should be made clear.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />

It's not clear, when one requests a value set resource, whether one should expect the definition or the expansion.<br />
There seem to be different use cases for this resource. One is an implementer needing codes, in which case we'd want to provide an expansion (a la CTS2 ""resolvedValueSet"").<br />
Another is a service needing a definition, in which case we'd want to provide either a define or a compose--however the VS is defined.<br />
But I need to be able to specify which one I want, which seems to me to suggest that the Definition and the Expansion should be different resources.<br />

A-Q<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
I'd like some clarity on the criteria for defining operations (beyond the restful http set). It seems that the reason for doing so would be to support asynchronous (stateful) functionality. This is 
<br />
listed as one reason, but it's not clear whether there might be others. For instance, expanding a value set seems like an operation, intuitively, but I'd argue
<br />
that an expansion is just another resource. The fact that it's generated dynamically doesn't really enter into it. Ditto for code validation. If these resources were defined, there would be no need for these operations, at least at the base specification.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
The essence of an operation is that the server is making some decision; the content returned depends on factors under the control of the server. In the case of expand, the server can return an existing resource, or create a new one it does not store. Because expansion is an operation, there is no expectation that expansions are searchable, for instance. ANd I think that the fact it is generated dynamically is relevant, though it may not be final. It's true that we could also define a resoruce for validation request/response and use this instead. in fact, that's how the FM resources work, and it's a problem.

While there are several codes in this value set that could be signer types on a Contract/Consent Directive, it is far from complete and there are a majority of the excerpted codes are inappropriate as signer types. The intent for this value set was not ""Digital Signature Purpose"" - so this statement should be removed. The intended purpose was to capture the roles played by signers to the Contract/Consent Directive.

Current there is no creation dateTime element which results in resources which use this such as Contract, Media, SupportingDocumentation having to add a paired optional elemet to contain this information. Not all file format incorporate creation dateTime nor is it efficient to re-parse the creation dateTime from the file data every time it is required. We should add the element directly into the datatype itself. (There is an existing tracker - this serves to reinforce and expand on that).<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

If we want to have Bundles be the information package for Transactions where each entry within the bundle may be the subject of a different FHIR Operation then we should separate the Operation name from the 'status' element, make its type 'coding' to support easy extension to additional operations, use this consistently for all operations rather same named such as 'update' yet using other fields to imply an operation such as completing the deleted element to indicate perfoming a 'delete', and provide a flag field to indicate whether the operation halts on eooros only, errors and warnings or none.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

we could signifcantly increase the compleity of transactions like this, yes. We could turn them into a monster. Not that they already aren't. I am opposed to doing this just because we can see a way to make statements when we haven't counted the cost of doing them, nor do we have any use cases for doing so<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Patient.animal<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
The inclusion of animal in the Patient is an indication of RIM-based design by constraint approach to resource design. In the applications that I have been able to survey, not one has a need to mix human and non-human patients in either an exchange or in the back end repositories. If you were to apply the 80% 'rule' you would create a Patient resource and a NonHumanPatient resource.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
There are many such systems; I managed one. We did create a patient and animal resource, but in the end this proved too difficult, and after much debate and trying several options, we elected to go with this least worst design<br /><br /><strong>Disposition</strong>:<br />
Not Persuasive<br /><br /><strong>Disposition Comment</strong>:<br />
There are examples of systems that mix human and non-human. Furthermore, human-based software can be used in animal-specific settings. There was a conscious decision in this situation to not follow the 80% rule to make clear that FHIR was intended to support veterinary care. The alternative - having a separate resource for animal patients would have required every reference to patient to instead reference two alternate near-identical resources. This complexity wasn't justified.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

There is no way to specify the preferred communication (or language) for a patient. For an individual codeableConcept in the coomunication list, one of the Codings may be marked as primary but this does not indicate the primary communication. The primary on Coding only serves to indicate the 'original' or 'preferred' coding is a series of synonyms (ie. English expressed in two difference coding systems).

Practitioners work with multiple organizations. This was identified in a tracker item but the proposed linking using Person really is not functional, so I am raising this again. To use the Person as proposed would limiting identifier to 0..1 and moving qualifications for Person (which in turn does not make sense if you are also using Person to point to Patients). Or the qualifications would need to be updated on each Practitioner instance for the various organizations the Practitioner works for.

I have concerns with this resource in general. In Canada, we never associate a Practitioner in the healthcare system with their interactions as a Patient within the healthcare system. This may be different in different countries. Also, this resource seems a large step backwards, FHIR originally had a Person in addition to Patient and Practitioner and the implementors said it made implementation needlessly complex. Patient already has a link class to link together multiple occurrences for an single individual, what use case is this solving? If it is necessary to link a Practitioner to their occurence as a Patient, then Practitioner should have a link (and I would need to be convinced that this was really something that the moajority of applications do)<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
need to add a little more documentation, but also, this is not the same as we had - Person is solving a different problem<br /><br /><strong>Disposition</strong>:<br />

Person allows linking a variety of types. It can be used to link multiple Patient records, link Patient and RelatedPerson records. It can also be used to link multiple Practitioner records. Will add language to make these multiple potential uses.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Cancellation, reversal or nullification depend on the current state of the Claim.

The vaccine type code system does not include needed granularity. The codes mirror an early release of CVX, though CVX is numeric strings with minimum length of 2 (DPT = 01). The flu vaccines are among those where the codes are inadequate. They do not include nasal flu, quadrivalent flu, intradermal flu, etc. We would be better served adopting CVX or RxNorm or other code system that is sufficiently granular.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

The usability of the codes is closely linked to the quality of the definitions. Although a definition is not required for each concept, a good definition SHOULD be provided. In the absence of any definition, there is no formal meaning associated with the concept<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
If we are going to allow a value set to define its own coded concepts outside of a containing code system that provides semantics for the concept it may be wise to require that a definition MUST be provided for these codes.

there are lots of codes out there in the real world that don't have definitions. On the other hand, the shareable value set profile should make definition mandatory. Which will be a problem for HL7 because HL7 has many codes with no definitions<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

Most code systems evolve over time, due to corrections, clarifications, and changes to approach or underlying knowledge or reality. If these changes lead to the meanings of existing codes changing significantly, then the interpretation of the code system becomes version dependent. This significantly complicates implementation based on the code system, to the point where it is not clear that safety can be assured, so SHOULD be avoided whenever possible.<br /><br /><strong>Proposed Wording</strong>:<br />

If the resource cannot be deleted because it does not exist on the server, the server SHALL return 404 (Not found). Performing this interaction on a resource that is already deleted has no effect, and should return 204. Resources that have been deleted may subsequently be brought back to life by PUTting an update to them subsequent to the deletion.<br /><br /><strong>Comments</strong>:<br />
Any delete on a non-existent resource should return a 204. A delete of a non-existent resource is always successful, in the same manner as ""Performing this interaction on a resource that s already deleted has no effect, and should return 204"". A 404 return indicates an exception, and when considered within a transaction, would serve to kill the transaction, when in reality, all is well. If there is a need to distinguish between fine grained FHIR-specific notions of ""delete but no really because I can bring this back to life"", then suggest the 404 be replaced with some other success code that can be interpreted in that finer fashion without automatically throwing an excaption.<br /><br /><strong>In person resolution requested</strong>:<br />

The most important of the identifiers is the Unique Device Identifier (UDI), which most medical devices are required to carry and which can be used to access the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID). The UDI has its own element (udi). The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely, or it may just identify the type of the device. A portion of the UDI - the DI part - can be extracted from the UDI when required, and used to look up information about the device through the GUDID.

The most important of the identifiers is the Unique Device Identifier (UDI), required by the FDA for every medical device to bear on its label (unless excepted). The UDI has 2 components -- the device identifier (DI), which is assigned at the version/model level of the device and the production identifier(s)(PI) which provide the means to track a device through its manufacture, distribution and use. The DI of the UDI is submitted in a device record to the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) and is used as the primary key to access other device information. The UDI has its own element (udi). The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely (when the PI(s) include a serial number), or it may just identify the type of the device. A portion of the UDI - the DI part - can be extracted from the UDI when required, and used to look up information about the device through the GUDID. The UDI can be broken into its constituent parts (DI and PI(s)) by parsing rules developed by each Issuing Agency standard.

Providing additional clarification - the UDI is not captured or stored in the GUDID. Only the DI is submitted; it is the primary key to all other device data elements.

One negative comment: FHIR should not be specifying resources that exist solely to represent value set definitions. By this I mean there is no need to define the content of an externally available value set using FHIR resources. By providing this function, FHIR must then support resources to create Value Sets that are fully compliant with the VSD DSTU. This is not a function that requires or is best served by FHIR. FHIR resources should require all necessary elements to fully specify a single value set expansion that meets the need of the implementation.<br /><br /><strong>Grahame's Comments</strong>:<br />
Implementers need to be able to share and reference value sets as resources. They are a key element of Profiles, Questionnaires, DataElements and other resources. Furthermore, the FHIR restful interface provides an easy mechanism for implementations to subscribe to, search for, retrieve, expand and otherwise manipulate value sets. Whether a given value set is ""externally available"" has no bearing on whether a resource should exist.<br /><br /><strong>Submitted By</strong>:<br />

<strong>Summary: </strong>Currently the patient deceased field breaks from first normal form (1NF). One proposal out of Connectathon8 is to create a new construct allowing for nullable boolWithDetails which would allow for true/false patient is deceased, and an optional deceasedDate field only allowed if deceased is true. This is in lieu of having the deceased field's datatype be determined at run-time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>
The Patient.Deceased Skype conversation opened up a bit of a wormhole on Saturday 1/17/15. There is an understood complexity underlying true/false a patient is deceased, and if they are deceased and the deceased date is known what was that date? In addition, at the heart of the FHIR model is a desire to prevent individuals from sending a data conflict – eg. deceasedBool: F, deceasedDate: 1/17/15.</p>

<p>
The current FHIR model attempts to resolve this by accepting either true, false, or a date. If a date is populated, it is known the patient is deceased and passed on that date. If true is sent then it is understood the patient is deceased but the deceased date is unknown. Lastly, if false the patient is not deceased.</p>

<p>
In testing the Epic FHIR endpoint returns</p>

<p>
&lt;deceasedBoolean&gt;false&lt;/deceasedBoolean&gt;</p>

<p>
&lt;deceasedDate&gt;0001-01-01T00:00:00&lt;/deceasedDateTime&gt;</p>

<p>
Which corresponds with deceased: False and C# implementation of DateTime.Min, often used to represent the a known null but for cast as a DateTime. This, however, according to Grahame and the FHIR model is an invalid value and will throw an exception in Ewouk’s FHIR library for .NET since the Deceased field is first cast as a FhirBoolean and then attempts to be cast as FhirDateTime, which is invalid.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
The FHIR implementation is not of first normal form, meaning you don’t know what type you’re getting back. Thus, writing code against this is hard. The problem itself, as Grahame points out, is hard and which it seems everyone agrees with. At the end of the day it boils down to how much logic should be put in the model vs left to the implementation of the model.</p>

<strong>Proposal:</strong> As a matter of consistency in interpretation by receiving systems and consistency in format by sending systems, Given and Family name elements of HumanName class be strings instead of IEnumerables. </p>

<p>
<strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>
I’m trying to best understand how one should go about working with the Patient.Name element. I can see that a Patient.Name is defined as a list of HumanNames, which are each comprised of FamilyName, GivenName, Use, Text (Full name) as well as a number of other elements. At first glance I’d expect that if you wanted to get the patient’s name you would loop over the list of Patient.Names selecting the HumanName with the highest ranked Use per your application’s needs.</p>

<p>
Where things get tricky regarding interpretation of a patient’s name is once you’ve narrowed down to a single HumanName you wish to use, both FamilyName and GivenName are IEnumerables with no relationship between the two; this results in a Cartesian production, for which I don’t think the receiving system has sufficient information to make that interpretation.</p>

<p>
Let’s say a source system sends out the following HumanName:</p>

<p>
{</p>

<p>
  given:[""Kathleen"", ""Kathy"", ""Kay""],</p>

<p>
  family:[""Smith"", ""Jones""],</p>

<p>
  use: “Official”</p>

<p>
}</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
For this patient, there are several possible displayable names you could list out:</p>

<p>
  Kathleen Smith</p>

<p>
  Kathleen Jones</p>

<p>
  Kathy Smith</p>

<p>
  Kathy Jones</p>

<p>
  Kay Smith</p>

<p>
  Kay Jones</p>

<p>
It's possible that this person never went by the names Kathleen Smith or Kathleen Jones.  The name ""Kathleen"" is on her birth certificate, but she never uses it.  To add additional complexity, when she was married, she decided to go by ""Kay"" (which is what her new husband affectionately calls her) instead of ""Kathy"".  In this case, there should be only 2 legitimate names for this patient:</p>

<p>
  Kathy Smith</p>

<p>
  Kay Jones</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
While that’s not necessarily the most helpful way to send out a patient name it is a perfectly valid one. Additionally, if the expectation is that the different name variations are placed into different HumanName objects then why are FamilyName and GivenNames IEnumerables instead of just a string element each? For a scenario where someone has multiple nicknames I would expect that they send out multiple HumanNames each with the Use: Nickname. By making GivenName and FamilyName strings instead of IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; there is an association between the family and given names of a patient at different points in time the source system is aware of. Furthermore, it precludes sending systems from having semantically different and yet acceptable sending formats and precludes receiving systems from interpretation errors.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Revisiting the first scenario, with Family and Given names as IEnumerables I think I’ve shown that are myriad ways sending systems could send the values and a myriad ways for receiving systems to interpret each. With Family and Given Names as only strings, for each Given &amp; Family name combination there is no longer flexibility in what name a patient may go by at any particular point in time and how it is to be sent by the sending system or interpreted by the receiving system.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
And, for the purposes of convenience, if a patient has only a single family name and given name, having those two fields as IEnumerables means parsing those two fields into the patient’s name is a more significant exercise than if they were simply just strings each. I realize there are Text and TextElement elements which are the full representation of that patient’s name, but given that they are not required fields and do not delineate what is family, given, suffix, prefix, etc. they cannot be relied upon as anything but an optional convenience.</p>

The last paragraph of the ""Scope/Usage"" section states "" The conditions represented in this resources are sometimes described as ""Problems"", and kept as part of a problem list."" However, this is in conflict with the status and timing attributes listed in the resource, which seem to indicate a use more similar to an observation.  Thus, it is not clear if this represents the ""Condition"" as represented at a point in time (e.g. a condition as present as an assement/impression section of a note), as opposed to something followed followed over time (e.g. remains on a problem list)and representing something observed on several occations.  For example, if encounter 0..1, and severity 0..1, and dateAsserted 0..1 then this implies that a patient might be seen for a condition (e.g. a condition recorded in a note for that visit), and the identifier for the condition would be required to be _different_ if the patient was seen at another encounter for follow up of that same condition, where a different severity (eg. resolved, worse, stable) was noted.   </p>

<p>
The instance identifier of the concept on the problem list would NOT change identifiers between visits, would most commonly be evaluated on several encounters, and may even change names or codes as the understanding of the clinical process is understood more completely.   The status on a problem list might represents the current last known observed state, but often does not if the problem has not been observed recently, and a statement that a patients condition has resolved DOES NOT imply that they never were observed to have the condition.  Using the current FHIR model, if condition means only the item on the problem list as the last know state, then there is no way to determine when/if the problem was active because the last dateAsserted would represent the time the condition was cleared.</p>

<p>
To fix I propose a separate resource for the item on the problem list which is called 'Concern' to align with prior patient care modeling (e.g. the 'concern' as recorded on a 'problem list' initally recorded as ""Rash"" and perhaps later recorded as 'Psoriasis') and leave this 'condition' resource to mean the point to record point in time observations (e.g a problem list as it exists in a note, thus encounter 0..1, dateAsserted 0..1, etc) and add clarification that the 'concern' resource representing items on lists which purposed for are followed a condition over a period of time, representing a set of condition /observations,  (e.g. items typically found on 'Problem lists' in an EMR). </p>

If caseSensitive is in the 80% for define, it shall be in the 80% for an expansion/compose. I'd love to kill caseSensitive on define, but if it is really deemed important, it should be consistently represented on expansion and compose.</p>

<p>
For compose one could reason that it should be a know meta item for the given codesystem but I don't think one should count on all valueset readers/implementers to have that knowledge hence again: if it really important enough to carry in ValueSet at all it should be consistently done.</p>

<p>
ValueSets are likely to serve multiple audiences in multiple languages. Shouldn't that be catered for? I mainly feel that datatype String is missing a language attribute:<br />

<p>It says it contains all codes from ""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/nutrition-order-status"">http://hl7.org/fhir/nutrition-order-status</a>"" except ""cancelled"". The way this value set does this, is:<br />

Consider ValueSet.compose.import. This is for importing a value set. Suppose I ask for an expansion on a value set that imports another. How does one get the expansion for the import?</p>

<p>
Can I assume the URI points to a FHIR ValueSet or can it be any format? Can I assume that the uri already asks for $expand? Could the uri be relative to my own server or may I assume absolute paths? Could the uri be a search rather than a specific value set? Could the uri be tied into a specific version (/ValueSet/1/_history/3) in which case I wonder if there is a missing uri pattern for expansions on history of a value set. Do include/exclude also operate on the imported value set(s), or only on code system?</p>

<p>
What do you do when there's a circular reference in imports? HTTP 413 Request Entity Too Large? HTTP 500?</p>

<p>
How do I even detect a circular reference when I ask the expansion for the import. When I ask for expansion on a value set it's not really possible to oversee the full chain unless every import is handled in two steps: ask for definition first and only ask for expansion if the result does not import any value set (version) that you have not processed before and hope that the value set does not import some you've already seen and some you have not.</p>

It seems to me that when people use phrases like FHIR ""profiling"" or ""to create a profile"", they actually mean using the full scala of tools available in FHIR to adapt the core to a specific usecase, e.g. creating extensions, restrictions, valuesets, conceptmaps etc, any of the resources we call ""conformance resources"". </p>

<p>
It is therefore very confusing that there is a Resource called ""Profile"", which convers only one of these aspects: constraining resources. The conversation therefore has to distinguish between ""creating a profile"" and ""using the Profile Resource"", which are not the same.</p>

<p>
I propose renaming the current ""Profile"" resource to ""ConstraintDefinition"", and use the word ""profile"" in the colloquial sense of creating a set of coherent conformance resources and publishing them. This would be more or less correspond to a ""conformance package"" or even an implementation guide.</p>

<p>
- the domain is not rational numbers. it's decimal numbers. The definition needs to be adjusted to as near to ""decimal numbers"" as will beat Lloyd's tautology reflexes</p>

<p>
- in XSD 1.1, decimal is split into 2 parts, with and without precision. Plain decimal is without precision. In FHIR, we simply impose precision over the top, but in XSD 1.1, we would use precisionDecimal. We should explain this</p>

If trying to compare elements and profiles using FHIR java reference implementation, you cannot use equals() to compare many of the instances nor add to Set collection, compare, etc. without creating series of helper methods.</p>

<p>
ElementDefinitionMappingComponent, Extension, Type, Element, and Base each don't extend Object.equals() or Object.hashCode() so a comparison must manually check all the possible member fields of those classes. Some sub-classes (e.g. <em>PrimitiveType)</em> extend Object.equals() so client applications and tools may need to keep track of which classes do and do not extend equals().</p>

<p>
Recommend to add <em>equals()</em> and<em> hashCode()</em> methods to base classes either org.hl7.fhir.instance.model .Base or org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.Element and override in sub-classes as needed.</p>

The vocabulary from ASTM 1762 doesn't include the definitions of the terms from the ASTM specification. Thus it is not clear which value to use for which purpose. The short name is not clear.</p>

<p>
From ASTM 1762 section 8.2.2</p>

<p>
Author’s Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of the primary or sole author of a health information document. There can be only one primary author of a health information document.</p>

<p>
Coauthor’s Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of a health information document coauthor. There can be multiple coauthors of a health information document.</p>

<p>
Co-participant’s Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who is a participant in the health information document but is not an author or coauthor. (Example a surgeon who is required by institutional, regulatory, or legal rules to sign an operative report, but who was not involved in the authorship of that report.)</p>

<p>
Transcriptionist/Recorder Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who has transcribed a dictated document or recorded written text into a digital machine readable format.</p>

<p>
Verification Signature</p>

<p>
—a signature verifying the information contained in a document. (Example a physician is required to countersign a verbal order that has previously been recorded in the medical record by a registered nurse who has carried out the verbal order.)</p>

<p>
Validation Signature</p>

<p>
—a signature validating a health information document for inclusion in the patient record. (Example a medical student or resident is credentialed to perform history or physical examinations and to write progress notes. The attending physician signs the history and physical examination to validate the entry for inclusion in the patient’s medical record.)</p>

<p>
Consent Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual consenting to what is described in a health information document.</p>

<p>
Signature Witness Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of a witness to any other signature.</p>

<p>
Event Witness Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of a witness to an event. (Example the witness has observed a procedure and is attesting to this fact.)</p>

<p>
Identity Witness Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who has witnessed another individual who is known to them signing a document. (Example the identity witness is a notary public.)</p>

<p>
Consent Witness Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who has witnessed the health care provider counselling a patient.</p>

<p>
Interpreter Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who has translated health care information during an event or the obtaining of consent to a treatment.</p>

<p>
Review Signature</p>

<p>
— the signature of a person, device, or algorithm that has reviewed or filtered data for inclusion into the patient record. ( Examples: (1) a medical records clerk who scans a document for inclusion in the medical record, enters header information, or catalogues and classifies the data, or a combination thereof; (2) a gateway that receives data from another computer system and interprets that data or changes its format, or both, before entering it into the patient record.)</p>

<p>
Source Signature</p>

<p>
— the signature of an automated data source. (Examples: (1) the signature for an image that is generated by a device for inclusion in the patient record; (2) the signature for an ECG derived by an ECG system for inclusion in the patient record; (3) the data from a biomedical monitoring device or system that is for inclusion in the patient record.)</p>

<p>
Addendum Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature on a new amended document of an individual who has corrected, edited, or amended an original health information document. An addendum signature can either be a signature type or a signature sub-type (see 8.1). Any document with an addendum signature shall have a companion document that is the original document with its original, unaltered content, and original signatures. The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document. Whether the original, unaltered, document is always displayed with the addended document is a local matter, but the original, unaltered, document must remain as part of the patient record and be retrievable on demand.</p>

<p>
Modification Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature on an original document of an individual who has generated a new amended document. This (original) document shall reference the new document via an additional signature purpose. This is the inverse of an addendum signature and provides a pointer from the original to the amended document.</p>

<p>
Administrative (Error/Edit) Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature of an individual who is certifying that the document is invalidated by an error(s), or is placed in the wrong chart. An administrative (error/edit) signature must include an addendum to the document and therefore shall have an addendum signature sub-type (see 8.1). This signature is reserved for the highest health information system administrative classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the permanent patient record.</p>

<p>
Timestamp Signature</p>

<p>
—the signature by an entity or device trusted to provide accurate timestamps. This timestamp might be provided, for example, in the signature time attribute.</p>

How does Provenance Resource really work? </p>

<p>
From the discussion at the F2F, It was recommended we use the Provenance Resource to point to the thing being reconciled by using the target element. So the target will point to the list resource (which in turn will point to the medication resource - in the case of a medication list). The question I have is, will we be able to tell from the list Resource that there is a target element that is referencing it? Stated another way, a reconciliation requirement is when viewing a list you should know whether or not and by whom or when the list was reconciled.</p>

<p>
It seems like for any Resource, if we're interesting in using Provenance, we have to query for both the Resource and the Provenance about that Resource. Is this the apporach to take? For Example, query for a list of medications and if we also need to know whether or not that list has been reconciled, we have to also query for the provenance resource whose target is the list itself? </p>

<p>
It was also mentioned that Provenance can be used to point to other things that may not use a List Resource - i.e. care team members (participant?) which is part of the care plan. How would we be able to reconcile the participants if we do not have an ID for the ""group"" of participants? Same applies to goals and activity in Care Plan. </p>

"===",5666,3,"2015-02-11 15:05:10+00","",".identifier - bring consistency to the cardinality and type across resources","<p>
This started in a FHIR on C-CDA discussion about Observation and the issue that the identifier property for observation is:</p>

<p>
&lt;<a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.identifier""><strong>identifier</strong></a>&gt;&lt;!-- <strong>0..1</strong> <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/datatypes.html#Identifier"">Identifier</a> Unique Id for this particular observation --&gt;&lt;/identifier&gt;</p>

<p>
whereas in most other clinical resources it is:</p>

<p>
&lt;<a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/adversereaction-definitions.html#AdverseReaction.identifier""><strong>identifier</strong></a>&gt;&lt;!-- <strong>0..*</strong> <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/datatypes.html#Identifier"">Identifier</a> External Ids for this adverse reaction --&gt;&lt;/identifier&gt;</p>

<p>
The use case for 0..* seems well established in the document and CDA world and used by many vendors.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Further surveying resources we find that there are only a few where the cardinality has been restricted to at most 1, and there are some where the type of the identifier property is something other than identifier.</p>

<p>
The request is:  unless there is some truly compelling reason to do otherwise, make all identifier properties defined as: &lt;<a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/adversereaction-definitions.html#AdverseReaction.identifier""><strong>identifier</strong></a>&gt;&lt;!-- <strong>0..*</strong> <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/datatypes.html#Identifier"">Identifier</a> External Ids for this adverse reaction --&gt;&lt;/identifier&gt;</p>

<p>
Where there is strong reason for using a type other than identifier, like string or url, we suggest that the property be renamed.</p>

Usage Note: ""REDACTED"" may be used, per applicable policy, as a flag to indicate to a user or receiver that some portion of an IT resource has filtered and not included in the content accessed or received.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
If a user asks for a set of FHIR resources in a search, and sets the summary only flag in the request, then I would like to label it accordingly. So information is removed from the resource, like in redacted, but not for the purpose of authorization. I thought abstracted would be usable, but it's something slightly different. </p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Can we have a security label for summarised to conserve bandwidth? I suppose it's not really a security thing, but it relates so strongly to the existing codes that I think it's a reasonable addition.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Discussion:</p>

<p>
* the requester knows that they are asking for a summary, though it may not necessarily be a summary that they receive in return (servers are not required to return summaries when asked to). But it's also true that clients are not necessarily well coordinated systems internally, and it's possible that a client could accidentally try to perform an update based upon the summary (different people write different bits, etc). In this case, the server can look at the tags, and see that they are performing an updated against a summary, and act appropriately (reject it, or process just the summary bits). That's why I like to tag summary resources.</p>

<p>
* The definitions of each of those possibly relevant codes gave me heartburn:<br /><br />
** abstracted: Security metadata observation values used to indicate the use of a more abstract version of the content, e.g., replacing exact value of an age or date field with a range, or remove the left digits of a credit card number or SSN.<br /><br />
*** no data is replaced. it's just removed.<br /><br />
** aggregated: Security metadata observation values used to indicate the use of an algorithmic combination of actual values with the result of an aggregate function, e.g., average, sum, or count in order to limit disclosure of an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) to the minimum necessary.<br /><br />
*** there's no algorithmic combination; data is just removed from individual resources selectively<br /><br />
** redacted: Security metadata observation value used to indicate the mechanism by which software systems can filter an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) to remove any portion of the resource that is not authorized to be access, used, or disclosed. Usage Note: ""REDACTED"" may be used, per applicable policy, as a flag to indicate to a user or receiver that some portion of an IT resource has filtered and not included in the content accessed or received<br /><br />
*** this is what happens - filtering a resource. But not for the reason stated. It's what I'm using currently. An alternative approach would be to extended the definition a little to allow it for reduction of bandwidth purposes.</p>

<p>
* These resources were added through harmoniation. the Harmonization proposal does not provide any evidence of the provenance of the codes before that.</p>

Currently, we have a set of interactions, described in http.html, which update profile, tags and security labels in a Resource's ""meta"" element. These interactions are special cases since:</p>

<p>
* They do not do CRUD on the full resources, but just on it's metadata<br />
* They take the datatype ""meta"" as body, instead of a resource<br />
* They can modify history too.<br />
* They cannot be used in Transactions, since the body is not a resource<br />
* The normal rest operations (esp DELETE) have no natural meaning on the _meta endpoint (you cannot ""DELETE"" meta), especially since you normally want to modify/remove parts of the tags/profiles etc in meta.</p>

<p>
Therefore it seems to make more sense to turn these interactions into operations, where the Parameters resource can be used to supply and return responses with ""Meta"" datatypes in the instances. This results in the REST interactions always returning a resource, the ability to include meta operations in a transaction and to others to have a natural way to define operations to do system-wide tag maintenance which are inline with the core-specified instance based operations.</p>

This has to do with the status values on ProcedureRequest and Procedure, in particular the ""proposed"" status value on ProcedureRequest. The problem is that a clinician proposes a procedure, he or she does not propose a ProcedureRequest.

(disclaimer - a body site resource I saw on a call yesterday does not look like this continuous integration build one--but I assume this is the current one)</p>

<p>
It seems that sites have been divided into specific sites, which may have laterality or plane, but no other refinements, and relative sites, which have a richer set of modifiers (""aspect""), but which treat the base concept as a ""landmark"" from which to navigate rather than as a spatial concept requiring its own modification.</p>

<p>
The FHIM has proposed a model in which a site concept has an optional modifier. This modifier could be laterality, but it could also be any of a number of other concepts (some of them are listed in ""aspect""; many are not).</p>

<p>
Unless we have use cases requiring this distinction, I'd recommend collapsing them, merging laterality and aspect (and plane?), and letting the selected set of properties determine what sort of site specification an instance is. The extra distinction doesn't seem to add value, but it does require that an implementer make a constraining choice.</p>

In other words it is <strong>not </strong>assumed that there is an ordering &lt; on version ids for which v1 &lt; v2 &lt;=&gt; version v1 is an <em>earlier</em> version of the resource than version v2.</p>

<p>
It might also be useful to be explicit about what equality on version ids means - although the spec says ""Both the Version Id and the Last Modified Date change any time the resource changes."", a stronger statement should be made to the effect that the same version id can never be reused for two different versions of the same resource.</p>

There is an inappropriate overlap between Condition.status and Condition.certainty. The values of status, namely Confirmed, Unconfirmed, and Refuted are really certainties, and they correspond to values in the certainty element, i.e.: Confirmed = Known Present; Unconfirmed = Known possible; Refuted = Known Absent. Having two elements that deal with certainty requires invariants to avoid logical conflicts, such as Refuted and Known Present or Confirmed and Know Absent. The final status value, resolved, is already covered by abatement[x]. So the status element is doing nothing more than repeating and possibly contradicting information found elsewhere in the resource. Condition.status can therefore be eliminated, without loss of information.</p>

AllergyIntolerance.status is a mixed bag. Three of the values, i.e. ""confirmed"", ""unconfirmed"", and ""refuted"" are certainties (could be renamed with certainty codes like known present, known possible, known absent). The other value, ""resolved"", deals with a change in the physical state of the patient, and corresponds to the abatement of the allergy. It would make more sense, logically, to split status into two new elements, AllergyIntolerance.certainty and AllergyIntolerance.abatement[x]. This would clear up the status and also bring AllergyIntolerance in line with Condition (allergies are kinds of conditions, so that also makes sense). AllergyIntolerance.status could then be dropped. Eliminating AllergyIntolerance.status also makes sense in a larger context because other resources use ""status"" quite differently, namely, to represent the business flow or lifecycle of clinical orders and documents. AllergyIntolerance is a significant outlier in this respect.</p>

<p>
""NOTE: Even if standard question definitions are referenced using &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;deReference&lt;/code&gt; extension, information such as the question text, data type and value set SHOULD still be declared for the question.  Systems processing the questionnaire may not have access to or support the ability to look up the question definitions from external sources.  If the information is not included in-line within the questionnaire, other systems may not be able to to render or use the Questionnaire.</p>

<p>
If an external reference (&lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;deReference&lt;/code&gt; extension) is included along with question information such as question text, data type or value set, it is expected that the content for the question and the referenced definition would be in alignment.  However, FHIR does not dictate what degree of<br />
alignment is required.  E.g. Does the question text need to match exactly?  Is it legitimate for a question to constrain the allowed value set of possible answers?  These rules will need to be established within implementation environments.""</p>

Elements are not consistent with existing requirement for submission of immunization information to immunization registries in the US. Four specific elements should be considered: (1) multiple birth indicator, (2) birth order (for multiple births), (3) mother's maiden name, (4) Vaccine program and (5) reason for non-compliance with vaccine program. Items 1, 2, and 3 are used by immunization registries to identify patients (especially infants) for whom limited information was available from the hospital dischage - to match these patients when reports are sent from a pediatrician's office. Items 4 and 5 are used to identify if the vaccine given is part of a special guarantee program (e.g., Vaccines for Children - VFC) and also why the patient who is eligible received provate stock or why a VFC vaccine was given to a patient who does not qualify for the program.<br /><br /><strong>Disposition Comment</strong>:<br />

Essentially the problem is, that the $translate operation does not allow me to supply dependsOn parameters to further specialize the translation, even though this could be present in the concept map.</p>

<p>
In the Device Clinical Bridge use case, a medical device that measures something like Hemoglobin in arterial blood might produce a measure in mass / unit volume, or moles / unit volume.  The code for the concept in the source vocabulary (IEEE) is something like MDC_CONC_HB_ART, with a units of any of the following:</p>

<p>
MDC_DIM_G_PER_DL</p>

<p>
MDC_DIM_G_PER_L</p>

<p>
MDC_DIM_MILLI_MOLE_PER_L</p>

<p>
The mapping depends on the IEEE Units of Measure code.  If a or b, then it becomes one LOINC code (30313-1), if c, then another (75928-2).</p>

<p>
So, in the translate operation, the dependsOn in parameter would be a composite (Tuple) in the form uri$codeSystem|code  to specify that the dependency value for uri was set to codeSystem|code. </p>

<p>
In that way, I could ask for a translation from IEEE to LIONC in the device clinical bridge as follows:</p>

<p>
[endpoint]$translate?coding=IEEE|MDC_CONC_HB_ART&amp;dependsOn=urn:hl7-org:v2xml#OBX.6.CONTENT$IEEE|MDC_DIM_G_PER_DL</p>

<p>
And get back a response telling me to use code 30313-1 from LOINC.</p>

<p>
This same challenge can appear in mapping from RxNORM to NDC, ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM, and ICD-9 or ICD-10 to SNOMED-CT (or vice versa), where a direct mapping could be made if the dependencies were specified, but no single mapping would be possible if one of the values is not specified.</p>

<p>
Without dependsOn, I see no way to use the translate operation for anything but the most basic mapping.</p>

At pesent, the comments on the definition of ValueSet.compose.import say:</p>

<p>
The value set URI is either a logical reference to a defined value set such as a SNOMED CT reference set, or a literal reference to a value set definition (not an expansion). If the reference is a logical one, it may not reference a actual FHIR value set resource; in this case, the referenced definition of a set of coded values needs to be clear about how versions are resolved</p>

<p>
At the terminology services connectathon it was suggested that it is necessary to differentiate explicitly between the two, so that intent is clear. </p>

<p>
I'm not sure that it is - the resolution is pretty much, try accessing it literally, and then if that doesn't work, ask your terminlogy server(s) whether they can resolve the reference by ValueSet.identifier. And in some cases - most FHIR value sets - the logical and literal are actually the same</p>

Use case:</p>

<p>
When I receive a POSTed bundle to insert/update, I'd like to do what's requested and let a client issue a new request to get the response bundle. This enables me to keep smaller chunks in memory and thus let the insert/update have a smaller footprint.</p>

<p>
As of HTTP 1.1 the preferred method for redirecting from a POST to a GET is 303. In browser lore HTTP 302 has always been doing that from HTTP 1.0 onwards, even though that was not the HTTP spec.</p>

<p>
In terms of support I can ony says that curl (7.37.1) handles 302 and 303 as a redirect where the redirect URL is POSTed (hence incorrectly), while Postman works just fine. It is to be expected that other clients behavior will vary too.</p>

<p>
I'm thinking that in part this is due to missing guidance or hints in the REST spec on when to use or expect redirects. If the spec doesn't say its possible it is likely that multiple clients will not be expecting any. Request to add wording in the REST spec that outlines optional usage of redirects in various scenarios</p>

In ""Using Codes in Resources"", in section 1.14.0.1 (or 1.21.0.1 in the continuous build) ""Controlling the use of Coded Values"", the explanation of binding appears under ""Complex Coded Data Types"", which implies that the notion of binding does not apply to the ""Simple Coded Data Type"".

<p>
Lloyd said, ""We should probably call out the ""Quantity"" data type as allowing a binding too, seeing as it's essentially a Coding."" But I don't understand that.

The removal of udi as a specific field has created unresolveable problems for implementers. These manifest in this language:</p>

<p>
The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely (when the PI(s) include a serial number). In this case the Device,identifier element is used. Or the UDI may just identify the type of the device and the Device.type is then used</p>

<p>
In the context this appears, this is a binary distinction being made here: either the UDI identifies an instance of a device uniquely, or it just identifies the type of the device. In practice, though, most UDIs will do neither, and implementers are unable to proceed. </p>

<p>
Nor, while I'm here, is there any information about how a UDI should be represented. Please add as many examples as necessary so that there is no ambiguity about how all UDIs that might be encountered should be represented</p>

For a application exposing FHIR resources there is often a need to expose information related to a given resource that is dependant on the actor requesting the resource or the context of the call.</p>

<p>
Authorization type information such as whether the calling actor has permissions to update the resource they have requested is related to the resource, but specific to the calling context.</p>

<p>
I believe it's highly desirable to separate this kind of information from the actual resource, this allows a system to store or re-distribute the resource as appropriate without worrying about whether they are accidentally distributing inaccurate information that related to the original calling context.</p>

<p>
Because of this separation, I believe that it would not be appropriate to put this information in tags / labels as they appear more appropriate for information about the resource that is the same regardless of what actor is accessing it. E.g. the Do Not Inform Patient security label.</p>

<p>
I believe that most of these context specific annotations will actually relate to ""allowed"" or ""valid"" next operations. For example, ability to edit, require a break of a privacy seal to see more, etc. Because of This I believe it would be good to allow for these context specific annotations to be links that could be followed to take the operation.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
To support the above, I propose the following changes:</p>

<p>
<strong>1) Addition of a links HTTP header on read &amp; vread operations</strong></p>

<p>
To maintain the separation of the resource and the context specific information I propose that use of the <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-5"">HTTP Link header</a> be standardized as an optional header to be added on the response to <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/http.html#read"">read</a> and <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/http.html#vread"">vread</a> operations as well as any <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operations.html"">operation</a> that returns a resource rather than a bundle.</p>

<p>
This would allow FHIR providers to include this kind of call context dependant information without including it in the core resource.</p>

<p>
I don't believe we need to add this capability to any operations returning bundles as there is already the <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.link"">Bundle.link</a> field to contain this type of information.</p>

<p>
<strong>2) Addition of a links element to Bundle.entry</strong></p>

<p>
Operations that return multiple resources in a bundle would need to return this type of call context driven information for each resource. E.g. in the authorization example above, the user may be able to edit some, but not all, of the resources returned. So we need the ability to define links for each entry.</p>

<p>
To achieve this I think we need to add a link element as a child of <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry"">Bundle.entry</a>. This should have the same structure as <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.link"">Bundle.link</a> but would allow for entry specific links.</p>

"===",5884,3,"2015-03-12 05:34:27+00","","Include a Recommended Pattern for Exposing Valid Operations on Resources based on Contextual Information","<p>
As Noted in the <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/security.html"">security page</a>, FHIR does not define any security related functionality, but any production FHIR system will require some form of Authorization controls. Where the consumers of the FHIR service may be untrusted (e.g. use from a browser based or mobile application) this authorization must be performed behind the FHIR service. This inherently means that not all actors will be able to perform all operations on any given resource.</p>

<p>
Similarly, there may be business rules on the server which mean certain operations are only valid for resources that are in a particular state. For example, it may not be permissible to update a archived observation.</p>

<p>
In either case, it is highly desirable that a client application is informed what operations are valid on a given resource for the particular actor / calling context. This allows client applications to render a user interface with appropriate controls. E.g. if a user is not allowed to update a given resource, they should not be shown an edit button.</p>

<p>
This is slightly separate from the <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/security-labels.html"">security labels</a> as this information is highly context dependent. Security labels such as ""Do Not Inform Patient"" are related to the resource, not which actor. Where as this kind of valid operations information is dependent on the actor and current state of the system.</p>

<p>
This applies both for the standard operations and any additional extension operations defined.</p>

<p>
Of note, while clients need to know what the valid operations are, it's desirable that clients have no knowledge of why the operation is valid / not valid. This allows a nice separation of concerns where the authorization or business rules can be changed without any changes needed to clients of the API.</p>

<p>
The contextual links proposal outlined in <a href=""http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=5883"">5883</a> would provide a location to return this type of information. This ticket is intended to add a documented standard for exposing the valid / allowed operation so that it can be implemented in an inter-operable way rather than as a vendor specific extension.</p>

<p>
I propose the following approach:</p>

<p>
For each resource returned from a read, vread, search, or other operation; each valid instance level operation on that resource is returned as a link associated with the resource. The relation of the link identifies the operation, the URL is the URL to follow to perform that operation.</p>

<p>
For type level operations such as create, the same approach is followed with the create operation being returned associated with the search bundle. The conceptual model behind this is that create is an operation performed on the list.</p>

<p>
<strong>Example: A read of an observation that the user is able to update.</strong></p>

<p>
GET /fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5</p>

<p>
Would return a HTTP Link header such as:</p>

<p>
Link: &lt;/fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5&gt;; rel=""update"", &lt;/fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5&gt;; rel=""read""</p>

<p>
The presence of the update and read links indicate these two operations are valid. The absense of a delete link indicates that delete is not a valid operation for this actor on this resource.</p>

<p>
<br />
The same approach can (and should in my opinion) be applied to <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/operations.html"">operations</a>, with the operation identifier being the rel.</p>

- recommendations provided from a decision support engine that a patient be on a particular medication<br />
- a care plan that includes a plan for a patient to be on a particular medication</p>

The Contract.signer is unclear:</p>

<p>
1) Now that there is a datatype ""Signature"" this datatype should be used. The Signature data type was patterned after the original proposal found in Contract. It contains the same elements and more that have been found to be helpful. It also explains the relationship of these elements to the content of the XML-Signature blob. It also clarifies that the blob must be base64 encoded, it can't be a signature as shown in Contract.signer.</p>

<p>
2) The Contract.signer is unclear what is being signed.  Presumably the intent of a signature across a contract, is intended to mean a ""Digital Signature"" across a contract.</p>

<p>
2.1) Is there an intention to show 'signature on file' coverage? Meaning that there is some way in the contract resource to show the various places where there is a 'signature on file' managed elsewhere. That this there is a signature on file that is not a digital signature, or is a digital signature managed outside of the Contract resource.</p>

<p>
2.2) Is there an intention to show a digital signature across the elements of binding, friendly, legal, or rule? If so, then these signature elements should be upon those elements to show context. Also if so, then there needs to be a clear differentiation between this signature and the signature that would be found in Provenance.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Given that there are many outstanding issues, and that the Provenance.signature seems capable of supporting the use-cases above; then I recommend that Contract.signer be eliminated until it can be more clearly explained in the context of these concerns.</p>

In this crunch time, many of us have noticed how fragile and inefficient the build system is. The fundamental problem is that everything is one big monolith - it all has to work, or nothing works; the bigger the monolith, the longer it takes. As more groups build profiles, and the scability problems are coming into crisp focus. </p>

<p>
Problem one is that the core points to the profiles. For example, the spreadsheets defining the core resources must be edited to add new profiles. Right there, that kills any chance at modularity. So the first thing we need to do is to make the core independent of the profiles. The specification of the core must be self-contained and inviolable; creating a profile must never change the core. Every place where the core currently points to non-core material, must be eliminated. Non-core can point to the core, but never vice versa. Correcting the direction of references will disentangling of the build system. It will allow folks to build their profiles locally, without recompiling the core. </p>

<p>
The second major piece of this is to disentangle the profiles from one another. DAF shouldn't be delayed because HSPC screws up. Profile build tooling can be designed to be more efficient. Ideally, the core and each set of profiles should have separate sets of documentation.</p>

"===",5935,3,"2015-03-19 03:28:15+00","","""Break the Glass"" Method Description in Security Labels Section is Very Limiting","<p>
The Security Labels page includes a section on <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/security-labels.html#break-the-glass"">Break the Glass</a>, which is a relatively common pattern. The pattern of including a break the glass header seems to be quite limiting on how applications can handle this approach.</p>

<p>
In the systems I have worked with, break the glass is always coupled with some kind of after the fact review of the action by a compliance officer or similar role to prevent abuse. Typically accomplished by any action that breaks the glass triggering an audit alert that is followed up on. This can be accomplished with the described approach.</p>

<p>
However, in order for the user to break the glass, they generally need to know something is being hidden from them that they need to break the glass to see. This is obviously a small leak of information but a necessary one to allow this kind of functionality. Without this information, applications have to display a ""do you want to break the glass"" option regardless of whether there is hidden information.</p>

<p>
This kind of pattern can result in users ignoring the break the glass option as much of the time it will have no impact on what information they actually see.</p>

<p>
Additionally, to make the compliance review processes efficient, the clinician breaking the glass is often required to enter an explanation of why they require access to the record. This can often allow the review of appropriate actions to be done without involving the clinician. The explanation can provide sufficient context to allow the compliance officer to decide the access was appropriate.</p>

<p>
Some systems I've seen go so far as to record a coded reason for breaking the glass to allow trend reporting. This can then be used to identify issues where access rules need to be adjusted as people are having to legitimately break the glass for normal situations rather than exceptional ones.</p>

<p>
None of this can really be accomplished with the simple break the glass protocol in the standard.</p>

<p>
I would suggest that this be replaced with a pattern based off the valid operations pattern described in <a href=""http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=5884"">5884</a>. Something along the lines of:</p>

<p>
The server decides when Break the Glass is a valid operation. This is implementation specific but generally something to the effect of; there is information the user cannot normally see but is allowed to break the glass to see. If break the glass is a valid operation, a link to the break the glass operation should be returned in the Link header.</p>

<p>
To break the glass the user must post a reason for access to the break the glass operation, in turn the user will be given a token. This token can be included in subsequent requests for information in order to retrieve the information the user is able to see with glass broken. Requests without the token will still return only the information the user is able to see without breaking the glass.</p>

Operations may be invoked using an HTTP GET ""If there are no parameters with complex types (including resourcse) to the operation, and the operation is idempotent (see <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"">HTTP specification definition of idempotent</a>), the operation may be invoked by performing an HTTP GET operation where all the parameters are appended to the URL in the search portion of the URL (e.g. after the ""?""). Servers SHALL support this method of invocation. ""</p>

<p>
OperationDefinition should therefore indicate whether an operation is idempotent so that the client calling or the server responding knows whether to allow the use of GET.</p>

To assist in better rendering of Questionnaires some additional layout hints would be good.</p>

<p>
<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-autocomplete"">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-autocomplete</a></p>

<p>
For use on Questions of type choice, The user input is expected to not present a complete list of entries for this valueset choice, as the list is anticipated to be large. Recommend using an autocomplete style, or popup searching style control. (For use with things like language reference sets)</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-select"">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-select</a></p>

<p>
For use on Questions of type choice, The user input is suggested to be a combo/dropdown selection list. The valueset list is not expected to be too long, but recommend that a radio list might not be appropriate.</p>

<p>
<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-horizontal"">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-horizontal</a></p>

<p>
For use on Questions of type choice, or Groups. The values in the choice (e.g. as radios) are to be displayed horizontally. For Groups, the children of this group should be rendered horizontally, rather than vertically.</p>

<p>
With this style of groups, the layout can be controlled to produce flowing content more easily.</p>

The $meta-add and $meta-delete operations can be invoked on a specific version of a resource, but the page does not explain how to do that.</p>

<p>
Per Grahame, the right way is to put the version in the URL, e.g.:</p>

<p>
POST <a href=""http://base/Patient/1/_history/2/$meta-add"">http://base/Patient/1/_history/2/$meta-add</a></p>

<p>
We should say this explicitly, since one could also infer that the version could come from the Meta element being submitted.</p>
