Two points to clarify then:</p>

<p>
1. Does Conformance.fhirVersion follow the same rules as Profile.fhirVersion</p>

<p>
2. What are those rules?</p>

<p>
e.g. I see other examples like:</p>

<p>
""0.12-2143"" (<a href=""http://fhir.healthintersections.com.au/open/metadata?_format=json"">http://fhir.healthintersections.com.au/open/metadata</a>)</p>

<p>
""0.12"" (<a href=""http://spark.furore.com/fhir/metadata"">http://spark.furore.com/fhir/metadata</a>)</p>

<p>
Do these follow some kind of grammar? Do they correspond to something in the normative text of the spec itself (produced by the publish tool)? Are these two values comparable? Equal? What's the algorithm?</p>

I have changed ProfileGenerator.java to split Resource(A|B|C) up into several TypeRefs, each with type=""ResourceReference"" and profile=#A. This led to the InstanceValidator triggering a validation warning (multiple types?). After I changed that, the ProfileValidator now gives an error, because when filling out a differential profile (in this case the diagnosticreport lipids example), these will result in several repeats of the TypeRef node (with type=ResourceReference) without the differing profiles. In other words, the specified profile on the base resource profile doesn't yet get correctly filled out. I tried to fix this in ProfileValidator's filloutElementDefn(ElementDefn n, ElementComponent e), but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

It's not really true for documents either.  Composition.text may well include some summary information about the author, custodian, etc. if this is considered important for human understanding of the document.  (It won't be rendered by the rendering algorithm for displaying a document for authentication.)  In List, we explicitly say that the List SHALL include summary information about the resources referenced in the List (often in a table form).  Otherwise, when you have a List referenced in a Composition.section, the content of the list wouldn't be rendered in the Document display.  We have some work to do in making the rules consistent or at least making very clear what the exceptions are and why they exist.  More discussion for core team required.</p>

I'd suggest the following as general documentation (in ""narrative.html""): Narrative for a resource should include summary information about referenced resources as necessary for a consumer of the resource to be able to understand the key essential information about a resource without retrieving additional resources.  For example, the narrative for a MedicationPrescription might include summary information about the referenced patient, prescriber and medication.  Some resources (e.g. List, Composition) may provide specific rules about what content must (or must not) be included in the resource narrative.  Consideration should be given to the fact that referenced resources may be updated without updating referencing resources, so the proportion of content of a referenced resource included in a referencing resource should be limited.</p>

Well, the retired has to be updated to change the status to be retired.  In doing so, pointing to what you're replacing it with seems reasonable.  And it's a whole lot more useful that way.</p>

Base is 0..1.  Complies with would be 0..*</p>

Based says ""here's the starting point against which deltas are applied"".  Complies says ""this compile profile complies with this other profile too"".  There can only be one base.  There can be 0..* additional complies.</p>

<p>
Any copy of a profile you don't chase down is going to continue to have a status of ""active"" instead of ""retired"".  Really, all you should need to do is update the source of truth copy (the one where id = identifier).  Everyone else is responsible for keeping their copy up-to-date with that copy (if they care about changes like retirement/replacement/etc. at all).</p>

Reliability isn't actually core.

I see Patient being in the 80%.  I see RelatedPerson as being pretty unlikely.  If you're doing a family history, odds are that all relatives will be tracked as part of a single questionnaire - which will still be a subject of Patient.  I expect that Medication, Device, Organization, Location and possibly Practitioner could all see use.  My suggestion would be to either add those or drop RelatedPerson.  (And note that other subjects can be noted via extension.)</p>

Consensus from Connectathon was to remove RelatedPerson (it was added for reasons that don't actually turn out to be true).  Also add a note that Questionnaires *can* be about other subjects (handled as extensions) and open issue about differentiating subject &amp; recordTarget (e.g. may have a questionnaire that's about a device that's also patient-specific and thus should live on their record)</p>

I would say that ""missed"" and ""rescheduled"" are both sub-types of ""cancelled"".  So these could be handled by sending ""cancelled"" and then using an extension to capture the further differentiation.  That doesn't mean that adding the new codes would be inappropriate (if we deem them within the 80%).  We would need to make very clear what the boundaries were though so that there was no overlap between the codes.  We'd probably have to go hierarchical as not all systems would necessarily distinguish.</p>

Value sets in FHIR don't have to be flat.  We can define (and publish) them as hierarchical when necessary.  As a rule, reflecting the hierarchy in the display names is frowned upon.  It tends to make them long.  However, we'll look to the patient administration work group to suggest the most appropriate (least likely to be confused) names.</p>

If Encounter.status=<em>planned </em>then Encounter.Fulfills.status in { <em>arrived | fulfilled | cancelled | noshow </em>} is not valid.</p>

<p>
Until Appointment.status=<em>arrived </em>would any EHR actually create an encounter associated with a future appointment with status=<em>planned </em>? Does this meet the 80% rule?</p>

It's very common for Encounter to exist before the appointment is deemed fulfilled.  If the hospital is doing ""billable"" things - prepping the room, doing pre-admit work, etc., that'll be tracked as an actve encounter well before the patient is supposed to actually show up for surgery.</p>

If you'd like to propose documenting recommended relationships, I'd add this as a separate proposal (this one's already been rejected).  That said, keep in mind that the encounters and appointments are separate objects that may be maintained by separate systems.  Clear alignment won't always exist, so all we can suggest is ""intention"".</p>

That said, a few comments on your proposed linkage:</p>

<p>
I' don't think ""pending"" could correspond to ""onleave"".  onleave implies that the encounter has initiated.  Also, there might not be an encounter at all for significant periods within the appointment's lifecycle.</p>

this needs to be revisited in the light of other changes. There is a requirement to return a meta with a 200. I think the way this should be done is:</p>

- if the client submits a delete with no body - server returns a 204 with no body</p>

- if the client submits a delete with a meta for the body - the server returns a 200 ok with an updated meta</p>

As far as I can tell, this schema is there to support embedding HTML in the XML. That is kind of questionable, since it will mess up the xml parsers used to deserialize. I can see why you might want to do this, but it causes real issues. Take a look at the .Net implementation on the website. You can see the developer removed the div element from his classes.</p>

<p>Now consider a developer accepts a feed from system 1, where they wrote custom serializers to handle this. They import into system 2, where they removed the tag because they did not want to handle this. The HTML gets dropped. Why support this in the first place if it causes trouble.</p>

<p>If the fhir team decides &lt;div&gt; is a good idea, we still need to be able to create classes with ""out-of the-box"" tools from these schemas. That means fixing the schema.  However, I still think it is a bad idea unless someone can tell me why it is.</p>

<p>One option to fixing this requires fixing xhtml1-strict.xsd. As long as the HTML does not violate the fixes everybody is happy. One change I had to make was:</p>

<p>  &lt;xs:complexType name=""form.content""&gt;<br />
    &lt;xs:annotation&gt;<br />
      &lt;xs:documentation&gt;<br />
      form uses ""Block"" excluding form<br />

      &lt;!--&lt;xs:group ref=""misc""/&gt;--&gt;<br />
    &lt;/xs:choice&gt;<br />
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;</p>

<p>But changes like thisw are hard, and different developers may do a different change. I think the fix should be in the original schema to prevent this fragmentation.</p>

<p>Attached is a typical link explaining the problem better than I can: <a href=""http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200008/msg00144.html"">http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200008/msg00144.html</a> The suggested fix here is to use CDATA to hold the HTML. I think this approach would be acceptable since you can contain the data without all the other problems that go with it when you try to make it XML.</p>

<p>Here is another: <a href=""http://evolt.org/node/27855/"">http://evolt.org/node/27855/</a>. The fix is inappropriate here as comments are lost during serialization.</p>

<p>The point is this is concept people are strugling with because HTML is not XML. If this is really required, I would vote for the CDATA approach. It is not perfect, but will allow the desired effect of embedding non xml in the xml.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the great opportunity of fhir is one of interoperability across languages and protocols. To acheive this, the generation of classes needs to be simple and foolproof. ""Out-of-the-box"" tools used for generating classes from other xsd's and serializing/deserializing these classes is a must have. Having custom classes created and precompiled for you is great, until you are using a new language, or database or the classes need to be extended.</p>

xhtml is proper xml, and this is perfectly valid xml that all xml parsers can handle just fine. </p>

<p>
Your problem is with schema based code generation tools that cannot generate code for xhtml correctly. Effectively, you want the xhtml moved out of the object model into a different layer - exactly what we do in the json. And frankly, Ewout and I who maintain the reference implementations would much rather do that. It's the object orientated engineer's natural view of the world. </p>

<p>
But the world is not composed only of object orientated engineers - there are also many many xml centric people, who object strenuously to moving the xhtml out of the xml and carrying it escaped or cdataed or whatever, because it makes xml handling harder. You can see an earlier comment of mine from our argument about this here: <a href=""http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=470."">http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=470.</a> This is why json will naturally become the preferred data exchange in the long term. </p>

<p>
I'm not sure that we can ""fix"" the xhtml schema - it's not ours, and I'd have to review the copyright etc. I'd like generation of classes from the schemas to be simple and foolproof, and we worked really hard to ensure that the fhir schemas are, The fact that the problems are in the external schemas, that are ubiquitious - well, it's both reassuring and painful. But surely we are the only ones with this problem?</p>

<p>if Fhir is defined in a number of spreadsheets, and the schemas are artifacts, then there is a problem, in my opinion. The schemas are what all major tools can uniformly handle and use for conformance checking. How are you supposed to accept data from one system that has it's own schema into a system with another schema ? I suppose this is a personal preference, but it seems to me the schemas are the definitions to be used by all tools. Generating schemas from spreadsheets is fine, but the schemas ARE the definition that eveyone needs to use.</p>

Joe, schemas are a problem - a schema for validation is a very different thing from a schema for code generation. I've thought about publishing 2 lots of schemas for this reason. It's not our issue - it's how schemas are. And schemas are very dumb, so they're not a great place to implement from. However many people will, because that's what the tools are for, so we care about them.</p>

<p>
But it seems that you are actually talking about the FHIR generator that generates the c# reference implementation, not the schema at all?</p>
",150
"===",3063,"2014-03-18 00:07:35.349607+00","<p>I guess we just disagree. Its Ok.</p>

<p>I see a schema as a great starting point to make classes. The classes allows population of the datastructure in a somewhat controlled manner ensuring a certain tree, with certain datatypes and names to be created - it's not 100% but it is mostly there. From the tree of classes, I can serialize to XML. I can then validate the XML against the original xsd to make sure the data conforms to the schema. I can even use schematron to make sure the values really comply, - such as a start date is before an end date. It seems so simple and obvious to me. The key to this world are schemas that do not have fancy stuff in them.</p>

<p>Two lots of schemas seem difficult to me. The real issues I see are few and fixable.</p>

<p>1 - Move HTML to CDATA.<br />
2 - Drop use of &lt;any&gt; where it is not really needed. ObjectType and TextType properties can be defined as something else.<br />
3 - Rename value to val. This is probalby a nuanced bug in .Net,  but why not rename the field.<br />
4 - Rename var to something (var is a c# keyword and creates IDE problems, I renamed it to Var). This is just a C# issue, but it is important.<br />
5 - Reconsider the mixed datatypes that end up defining ""object"" types. ie, deceasedX in Patient object. Why not allow both fields, instead of using a choice element.<br />
6 - Reconsider the use of mixed datatypes in lists like FeedType.Items (defined as a list of different items) Why not define lists of each item desired.</p>

<p>These are C# issues. I assume JAVA has it's own - but they should be addressed as well. From my examination of the schemas, it seems the same goals can be acheived, just by using some slight naming changes or different appraoches.</p>

1 - I guess this is issue #3062<br />2. what else would they be defined as? Atom defines them as &lt;any&gt; logically, so the schema doesn't have much freedom<br />
3. So this is a bug in the .Net xsd generator itself? It can't cope with xml attributes called ""value"" - really? I find that hard to believe<br />
4. where do we even use ""var""? <br />
5. here is a good case of where a validation schema isn't the same as an object schema. The committees have decided that these fields are logical disjunctions, and you can only have one or the other. <br />
6. We didn't define this - it comes out of atom. I guess you're saying, not one can work with atom with the code generation tools. </p>

#5 - I don't think you're looking in the schemas at all, but the C# reference implementation - a quite different beast.

ok, thanks for clarifying. I tend to ignore the xhtml schema when looking through the schemas, because well, surely the tools work with such a ubiquitious schema. Apparently not... </p>

<p>
So, let's just explore #5. Here the schema says: </p>

<p>
          &lt;xs:choice minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""1"" &gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;<br />
              &lt;xs:documentation&gt;...&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;<br />
            &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:element name=""deceasedBoolean"" type=""boolean""/&gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:element name=""deceasedAge"" type=""Age""/&gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:element name=""deceasedRange"" type=""Range""/&gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:element name=""deceasedDate"" type=""date""/&gt;<br />
            &lt;xs:element name=""deceasedString"" type=""string""/&gt;<br />
          &lt;/xs:choice&gt;</p>

<p>
This is clear, and serves validation. We could define this some other way - simpler, with less rules, which would serve the code generation, but reduce validation. This is an example of the trade-off between generation and validation. </p>

<p>
As for why not allow more than one of these - what would it mean to have more than one, and have them disagree? that generates much more work, at a later more costly stage in the development cycle. So after much discussion, we elected to only have one marker, with a variety of types. That xsd.exe chooses to convert this to a polymorphic object, well, that's their choice based on their own extensive argument (I guess).</p>

<p>
I don't think there's an easier way here - anything we do is a compromise somehow.</p>

<p>
I'll research the issues with atom and xhtml schema more - but surely we're not the only ones to use these schemas? You can't tell me that no one else wants to use these schemas with portable class libraries?</p>

I'd like to add my +1 to switching Patient.gender to Code from CodeableConcept. I've now twice explained FHIR to a group of developers, and the Patient resource is always where I start (I'd like to nominate Patient to be FHIR's ADT^A01) and the first thing people latch onto when they see a resource instance is the fact that gender is a repeatable element.

As one further note, it might be nice to define a standard extension which can be tacked onto a param (or a chain if my suggestion is accepted) that indicates whether that param supports AND / OR queries. I guess really this should be two extensions...</p>

James, can you clarify what the following would mean:</p>

<p>
 &lt;searchParam&gt;&lt;name=""subject.identifier""/&gt;&lt;chain value=""name""/&gt;&lt;/searchParam&gt;</p>

Sorry, that was worded badly.. I mean specifically a search for DiagnosticReports by subject patient mrn *AND* name (aka report type), which is a combination I have dealt with before. Another common combination would be subject patient mrn *AND* date range. </p>

<p>
With the current Profile definition, I can specify that subject patient MRN, name, and date are all valid parameters but I can't specify that they need to be used in combination. My view here is that most servers will be optimized for a set of parameter combinations, as opposed to supporting any possible combination as the reference servers do.</p>

Thinking about this some more, another possible (maybe-less-breaking) solution would be for Conformance.Rest.Query to make the name optional (i.e. make Query.name be 0..1 instead of the current 1..1) and to add a new optional element in Query that indicates the type of resource that the query returns (I think this would be a good addition anyhow).</p>

<p>
Ultimately the problem I'm trying to solve here is allowing servers to explicitly state that they support searching using a non-named query by ""Resource.paramA *and* Resource.paramB"" but not neccesarily searching by ""Resource.paramA *or* Resource.paramB"". This could be accomplished by putting a query in the profile that has no name or definition but has two searchParam entries.</p>

<p>
With this allowed, a server like the Graheme's reference server could expose all of its paraemeters via Conformance.Rest.Resource.SearchParam. On the other hand, a less flexible server could specify no Conformance.Rest.Resource.SearchParam entries, but could expose it's searfch param combinations as Conformance.Rest.Query instances.</p>

On the Clinical Genomics's weekly conference call on 2014-05-20, the change proposal was reviewed additional questions were raised:</p>

<p>
* interplay between linking to additional patient records and policy driven access controls.</p>

<p>
* whether a link to a relation's records is 0..1 Resource(Patient) or 0..* Resource(Patient). While in integrated healthcare delivery systems 0..1 may be sufficient, in the fragmented US system, 0..* would be useful. That is especially true if links to records from years ago, due to a prior episode of cancer for example, are needed.</p>

Given that we use Questionnaire for both instances and form designs, I think it's quite reasonable for author to serve two different purposes depending on the status.  I think that capturing who designed the form on a questionnaire instance is outside the 80% - not something many systems or users would care about - and if they did, they'd want lots of other metadata about the form design too - meaning they should go retrieve the form design . . .</p>

For consistency, want to use the name ""publisher"" and ""telecom"" instead of ""Authority"" and ""references"".  That's what we do for similar artifacts (value set, profile, extension definition, etc.)</p>

<p>
Do we really think that the specific coder of the questionnaire is in the 80%?  I can't recall ever seeing it on a paper form.  Does anyone see it in software that does questionnaires?</p>

<p>
Don't understand why we'd copy the publisher metadata from the Questionnaire to QuestionnaireAnswers.  In FHIR the general rule is to not repeat stuff.  QuestionnaireAnswers already has a reference to Questionnaire that could be traced.</p>

It's not clear that health quality measures will actually be documents in FHIR - they don't necessarily need to be.  That said, it's certainly possible to have documents that talk about things like procedures and conditions outside of the quality measure space too.</p>

The list of possible subjects seems somewhat arbitrary.  Obviously ""patient"" is in the 80%.  It's not clear how many of the others are (i.e. how many of these resources are ones that 80% of systems capable of creating/dealing with documents would support documents about Devices or RelatedPersons).  May make more sense to trim this down to just Patient and add a note that extension can be used to capture additional subjects (and the extension might be appropriate as Resource(Any)).</p>

It's fairly heavy to require a provenance resource just to communicate something like author (or creation time, for that matter).  Where participations are common, we expose them directly.  Provenance only needs to be invoked when you're wanting to sign something or want a formal event log or something like that.  That said, we probably need to provide some guidance about that and acknowledge the possibility that data conflicts can exist if people aren't careful.  (Also make it clear that if there's a specific participation on the resource and you choose to populate a Provenance instance as well, that you still have to specify the participation link on the base resource.)</p>

Discussion with Grahame was that the use-case for missing system was when the expansion includes ""Categories"" or abstract concepts that label/group other concepts and are intended to be represented in the display or navigation of the expansion.</p>

<p>
However - there's no clear rules for how these would actually calculated/determined when going through the automated expansion process and manual expansions that add extra ""stuff"" are rather problematic.  We need documentation of exactly how Grahame's use-case is supposed to work with real systems, or we need to make this 1..1.  As well, the absense of the code system as the ""cue"" that a given code shouldn't be selected is sort of clunky.  Sometimes the abstract categories will actually *be* codes, so suggesting they don't have a code system is inaccurate.</p>

The proposed disposition is a problem because it excludes an expected behaviour that is not that unusual when dealing with expansions: the expansion includes arbitrary grouping structures that do not correspond to formal concepts (even abstract ones) defined in the underlying code system (which is why system and code are optional). Neither the define nor compose structures provide formal support for defining these arbitrary groups because there seems to be no consistency in how they are defined, and often they are not defined in the valueset. So they've been left to extensions. But making the system required prohibits this</p>

<p>
Instead of the proposed disposition, I have done the following:<br />
* left system as 0..1<br />
* added a rule that if a code is present, a system must be present<br />
* added ""abstract : boolean"" as decided above<br />
* added a rule that if there is no code, abstract must be true<br />
* added documentation of the case where there is no code/system on the contains entry<br />
* added a note to the expand operation about why server expansions may differ from each other </p>

* Make all profile references consistently use ""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/Profile"">http://hl7.org/fhir/Profile</a>""</p>

* Make the examples follow our best practice of including a ""major version"" part of the Profile.version in the logical id in the url, so Profile/iso-21090-v1.  This assures that breaking changes (which are reflected in the major version part) result in referencing a new instance of a Profile.</p>

The reasoning to make versionDate an instance was that it is generated by tooling anyway (save date of the profile). I would be happy to accept date+time if the majority likes that. The only reuqirement would be that it is a ""computable"" date (format and precision fixed).</p>

it can't be talken for granted that the date is generated by tooling - for some value sets, of course, it will be. But others are generated automatically from, say, SNOMED CT reference sets, for which only a date is available.

Note that the date indicates when was the status changed.  It doesn't indicate any other sort of change.  All of the HL7-defined value sets capture only a date.  If you care about the date the last version was created, that's resource metadata (sent outside the resource) and is a full timestamp.</p>

@Lloyd: that is exactly out point: a template version is identified by id and (we call it effectiveDate) date, regardless of status, from the time it came into being until it is retired. Why is the term <em>date</em> ""underloaded"" with ""date of change of status""?</p>

Dates are not used as identifiers in FHIR.  Profile business versions are identified by Profile.version.  Profile technical versions are identified by the resource version id.  The date a technical version came into being is handled with the lastUpdateTimestamp.  The date the status of a business version last changed is handled using Profile.date.</p>

Conclusion:  Mandate for the presence of Encounter in ALL clinical resources leaves us uncomfortable.  Nevertherless, there should be ""standard patterns"" defined for linking to Encounter in those cases where it is needed (to avoid variance across the FHIR resources).

+1 on this item. I think it should be given a high priority. The status quo makes it very difficult to use extensions correctly in any environment where multiple servers are in use (dev/prod environments, multiple organizations trying to share extensions, etc.).</p>

<p>
Id like to also propose that a search parameter be added to the Profile resource called ""authoritative-url"" so that extension definitions can remain discoverable when this facility is used (i.e if the DEV system is used to define a profile, the production system can host a copy and not need to reach out for a copy)</p>

This is a request for guidance on how to encode into SecurityEvent the details of a security-relevant event that includes security-tags. The point is to what extent are the security-tags important to record in the security event (audit log entry)? And if they are important to log, where in the SecurityEvent should be be recorded. My initial reaction is that these security-tags are unnecessary to record in the audit log. The security system was the one that creatted the security-tags, thus they could be re-identified at anytime by the security system.</p>

<p>
The securityEvent model is based on a chain of standards (ASTM, ISO, IHE) that have as a fundimental principle that the security log should not contain unnecessary detail. This is why we only record the unique identifier of the patient, as we know we can 'look-up; the detail in the patient directory. Same goes for User (e.g. Provider), Report, Order, Result, Document, and FHIR resource instance. Thus my recommendation would be to explain this fact, which results in clear instruction that recording the security-tag is unnecessary and potentially problematic.</p>

Thus the discussion recorded at the July 8th meeting does not seem to be on target.</p>

Does updating tags create a new version of the resource now?  If not, there's still an issue because Provenance normally points to the data associated with a change by linking to a specific version.  However, if there isn't a new version created when tags change, then there's no version to point to that would convey what the tag values are. </p>

(Also note that this issue isn't limited to security tags - there would be provenance issues related to changing workflow tags and other tags too.)</p>

Don't think we need bundles.  Having things as stand-alone resources without contained elements is fine.  We can (and are) using hyperlinks in the HTML rendering of the examples to allow you to jump to the referenced resources.  We should only use bundles if we're specifically trying to show an document, message or transaction or something that requires it.  Otherwise, the instances should be independent.</p>

I think there's a problem with this.  When you query, you don't specify a profile id.  So there's no way for the server to know what profile you're using.  And you don't want different servers returning different things in summary (though not all servers will necessarily support all elements).  Finally, servers may want to optimize to be able to return summary information more quickly (e.g. by caching it).  Varying this (and in particular, expanding it) by profile creates a problem.</p>

<p>
It's fine to expose this - because it should appear in the resource-definition profiles.  However, it should always be the same in profiles based on a given resource.  We should explain this rule as part of the element.</p>

Merely saying ""the content of the specific Questionnaire they are building needs to be assessed"" is a pretty useless motherhood statement. In fact, I think it's useless. Do you think people would build a questionnaire, not think about that, and then blame us for not telling them to think about it? </p>

<p>
If ywe're going to say anything about this, we need to say something useful, like, ""how do you assess it""? How do you say things about it? A set of answers to a questionnaire might be more sensitive because of the question, or just because the answert to an innocuous question. </p>

I don't think so in this case, because the question is around expectations for how to use the value field. If OO wants to say ""exceptions are handled using this extension"" - fine; though it won't stay an exception for long because every system I know of has to handle exceptional values in measurements. but if OO leaves things as they are, the extension is irrelevant because the excpetional value goes in value</p>

practiceSetting Proposal</p>

<p>
Add practiceSetting as a new property: DocumentReference/context/practiceSetting<br />
    of type DocumentPracticeSetting (Example)</p>

<p>
This property may convey specifics about the practice setting where the content was created, often reflecting the clinical specialty. This is an important piece of metadata that providers often rely upon to quickly sort and/or filter out to find specific content.</p>

<p>
The value set for this content is bound by Example because it is a value set decided by community policy. Several examples exist for consideration:</p>

<p>
I. HITSP created this table: HITSP/C80 Table 2-148 Clinical Specialty Value Set<br />
    a value set based upon SNOMED-CT<br />
    which is referenced by Direct (XDR and XDM for Direct Messaging Specification, Version 1), as well as Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), Query for Documents<br />

Using a code for both is probably wise, however status is generally something that must be understood by the receiver.  The codes should be complete, but may not always be sufficiently granular.  If a more granular concept is needed, it should be conveyed by an extension.  E.g.

Making Practitioner.name.text repeat would be inappropriate as each HumanName instance represents a single name.  However, Practitioner.name could itself be made repeating.  The question is whether most systems support multiple names for a practitioner.  If they do, we should make the element repeat in the resource.  If not, we should use an extension to capture additional names.</p>

I would intepretting the 80-20 rule in this case as ""there is a canonical bijective map between the FHIR data model for a human name and 80% of the types of names use world-wide.""</p>

<p>
As to the question about use case:  I am currently assisting in setting up an SMS-based health worker communication system as part of the emergency Ebola reposnse.  Here we are synchronizing between a healthcare provider directory and an SMS communicaiton bus (in this case the directory is based on CSD, but this would apply to HPD and other ).   The SMS communication bus has a JSON RESTful API, and FHIR seemed to be a natual choice to synchronzie between the directory and the communications system.  For more details, see: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1qQUaPm"">http://bit.ly/1qQUaPm</a></p>

<p>
Another use case:  a client is executing a searching for a practitioner by, for example location, the result set for a practitioner should return all of the available names for that practitioner.  That way the user can determine that they found the correct practitioner after they have changed their name.</p>

<p>
Also note that the current human name model has 0...* for givenName, prefix, family and suffix.  Honestly I am a bit confused by how the multiples are supposed to be used.  </p>

I read the W3 page you refer to carefully a number of times (and again, now.). I don't see the issue...? perhaps there's a subtle one around Chinese generational names. That's culture specific, just like the Dutch voorvoegsel. Other than that, it seemed ok to me</p>

<p>
""Also note that the current human name model has 0...* for givenName, prefix, family and suffix.  Honestly I am a bit confused by how the multiples are supposed to be used.  "" - a typical anglo name - John Peter Smith - 2 givens, and a family. Fromt the W3C page - María-Jose Carreño Quiñones - one given, and 2 family names. Mr Sir John Smith - 2 prefixes. (have you looked at the examples?) - in fact, give me names you think don't work, and I'll add them to the examples. </p>

<p>
Past names: I believe that PA determined that only a minority of systems support these. Further discussion to PA on this. (I assume that the particular use case above the HPD maintains multiple names for provider for if their name changes?) </p>

Reading the existing documentation, it was not clear to me how I would map from IHE's CSD and HPD profiles, nor from ISO 21091:2013.     My initial intpretation on the described data model was obviously not how you were intending it to be used.  <br />
 </p>

<p>
It would be quite helpful, for those of use coming in from outside the FHIR community, to have more precise documentaiton on who we are supposed to interpret/map things like patronymics into the mult-value fields like givenName.   It would nice to see  a bit more precision than ""see the examples.""</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Perhaps we can change the title of this bug of ""Provide better documentation on the use of the humanName data model.""    Not-with-standing the two items below, I don't really care which data model that you use to represent the data, I just would like to know better how to interpret it.  The two items which I would still suggest changing are:</p>

<p>
1)Assuming that name.text is similar to ""cn"" or common name in LDAP data models, then make the name.text element a 0..n.   Without this, it will be difficult to represent fully the data in many existing health care provider directories as FHIR practitioner resources. </p>

<p>
2)Allow multiple names for a practitioner so that one can capture the distinct names that a practitioner can be referred to.  It is not uncommon for a pracitioner to change their name, to have multiple names, or mutliple representations of their names in different scripts (e.g via RFC 4646 which you mentioned on Skype).  </p>

<p>
Then again, all of this may be out of scope for FHIR (I didn't see a clear statement about what is in considered in scope).  Having a multitude of names is certainly used in a number of common use case in the public health/health systems side of things.  Perhaps this is not needed in support of the clinical workflows that seem to be the focus of FHIR (as seems to be indicated as the pracitioner resource is being managed by Patient Administration subgroup)? </p>

<p>
that ""though you can't infer any particular meaning from the position in the order"" for the addres data model.  This is perhaps a bit inconistent with the humanName in which it seem that one should be infering something from the position in the givenName, etc. fields.</p>

"===",3500,"2014-09-08 21:26:39.594155+00","<p>
I don't agree with making name.text 0..*. cn is just a plain string, so we should be making name 0..*, which is your second point. </p>

<p>
So that means that this tracker item proposes 2 changes:</p>

<p>
* add further documentation. Maybe if we add a table showing where commonly asked things go in the name, and note that additional illustration is available in the examples (note: the examples used to be in line in the definition, but it made the page extremely long)</p>

<p>
* Change practitioner so it has multiple names. (I agree it's not needed for a narrow interpretation of ""clinical workflow"", which is why it wasn't added, but the nature of FHIR is such that it will integrate directories more natively into the clinical flow, so it's not wrong to add additional names to the resource, even though it creates difficulty for many systems that only allow one name. We should provide advice about which name to take as a preference)</p>

The purpose of the address data type (and all data types) is to capture only those elements that are supported by a significant majority of systems.  Any requirements that are limited to a few countries (or a few healthcare disciplines or organizations or projects or whatever) are handled using extensions.  Use of extensions is expected to be typical for FHIR implementations.  We've already defined one extension on address (for the US concept of ""county"") and will be defining many more to cover all of the nuances supported by the ISO 21090 data types.  Additional country-specific extensions are welcome and we'd be happy to publish them alongside the specification to make them easy to find.  If you think we've missed any core concepts (address parts that would be supported by the majority of software systems), please indicate.  If extensions are causing you particular grief, please explain.</p>

<p>
Agree that clarifying that the type can be used for both postal and physical addresses would be appropriate.  We'd want to retain the term ""postal address"" but would want to add ""physical address"" as well, while also noting that it's limited to ""postal style"" of address - i.e. not GPS coordinates or other means of defining physical location.</p>

Perhaps you could provide some examples. ""having a 'plot'"" doesn't really clarify what the requirement is here. </p>

As for postal vs physical - the reason we don't have this is because address is expected to be for delivery of content. If you want to describe a location, we have a location resource, and that should be used instead</p>

which should provide plenty of examples.</p>

<p>
Under the assumption that FHIR aims to achieve interoperability across international borders, if I were to interpret the 80-20 rule in terms of the address data model, then it would be something like ""there should be a canonical bijective map between the FHIR representation of an address and 80% of the addresses structures used in the world.""  </p>

<p>
Taking a quick glance at some of the example countries in the above link, I don't think that this is currently the case.  </p>

<p>
I think that some small structural changes can be made to the data model which would could cover most if not all of these addresses without needing to resort to ""let a country define an extension.""  This could provide greater consistency across countries.</p>

<p>
I am making the assumption here that ""line"" is an unordered array.  Perhaps if the order of the ""line"" elements had meaning, then it could work.  But then it should be clarified that order is important. </p>

<p>
I am not sure that simply enforcing an ordering on line elements would be enough (e.g. if you need to extract the county component of the address in the US context).  What would be more robust is to allow for and address to include key-value pairs where the keys are a code in a code system.   The code systems would be defined for each country.</p>

I looked at several countires, including the ones you nominated and nothing leaped out at me, except for ""sub-locality"", which maybe is a candidate for core. It's the only extension I've seen used in practice so far. </p>

<p>
The lines are a list, which means that they are ordered, though you can't infer any particular meaning from the position in the order. I agree that it wouldn't hurt to make that explicit (for name parts as well). </p>

<p>
It sounds easy to say ""key value pairs"" - it sure makes life easy for the writing system that has a fully structured address (17 components for Australia, at least in the Post Office's wishful thinking version of the world), but it leaves the typical systems that don't capture these structured components out in the cold, and it makes life tough for anyone trying to read the address - how do they read it? </p>

Unless you want to nominate particular countries where you think there's gap, I think the only issue where is whether county / sub-locality is core or an extension</p>

"===",3501,"2014-09-04 05:17:55.243541+00","<p>
That's not a correct interpretation of the 80% rule.  The rule is ""FHIR only include those address parts that 80% of systems in the world use"".  So 80% of systems in the world have the concept of ""country"" and ""address line"" and ""city"", so those make it into the core.  On the other hand, 80% of systems through-out the world don't support the concept of ""county"" or ""rural route number"", so that doesn't make it into core.</p>

<p>
All things that don't make it into core are handled using extensions.  You haven't indicated why using extensions is inappropriate.  </p>

<p>
Address has two pieces.  ""text"" is a complete representation of the entire address (all lines, city, state, country, postal code, etc.) as it should be displayed on an envelope or equivalent.  The remaining elements are for extraction of particular information for display in individual fields in user interfaces, to aid in searching, etc.  If you need an element that isn't in the core list, you create an appropriate extension for it and use that.  So there's no need to ""extract"" county from the text.  You send the county as part of the text and you also send an extension that explicitly contains the county.  Any system that wants to search or filter by county uses the extension.</p>

<p>
The key-value pair system you describe is more or less what extensions do.  They only difference is that there are certain ""common"" keys that we convey elsewhere for convenience and also to help encourage consistency around support of a minimum common subset.</p>

Agree with Ewout that we could never say that the default was other than 0 / false / nil. But we clearly have situations where missing means unknown. So what I think we should do is introduce an explicit ""Default Meaning"" column, and document explicitly where we think that a missing value means something other than unknown.

I don't think we can say that missing means unknown.  Sometimes data will be withheld.  Sometimes it'll even be withheld at the request of the querier (e.g. Summary or a query).  No data just means ""no data"" - nothing can be inferred about why the data was not transmitted.</p>

<p>
I don't think we can allow default meanings if there's any reasonable circumstance where an existing system might not know the difference.  For example, Patient.animal is not something that all systems are currently going to distinguish.  The system may well capture that it's a human or a patient in text/narrative and not have any technical mechanism of determining whether to send the Patient.animal element or not.  (Added 3655 for this specific issue)</p>

I'm not really convinced on this one.  First, there's a question of the 80% - what do most systems do now?  I think it'd be hard to argue that most existing systems support capturing multiple relations as a single record (other than FamilyHistory - which is completely separate from this resource).  Second, combining multiple things into a single resource isn't (in and of itself) a good thing in FHIR.  The boundaries of the resource are established based on what has a natural identity and tends to be modified as a single unit of work.  In this case, that would be the relation.  Third, any record that spans multiple patients creates privacy/access control complexities.  Fourth, there are already alternate (more commonly used) solutions to managing linking of diverse patient records.</p>

All that said, it's up to PA to decide, not me :&gt;</p>

Thanks for the feedback, Lloyd. With a Patient resource, associations to other Patient resources across organizational boundaries can be managed in the Links collection of the Patient resource. I'm not sure that's the common solution you had in mind, but you could certainly build a graph of patient relationships that way. But in a data sharing scenario, this isn't efficient. It would essentially require that every node in a network of Patient resources be aware of every other node. My proposal would allow implementers to create a star network of related Patient resources, where the only relationship that the Patient resource needs to know about is the RelatedPerson. As for privacy and access controls, I'm not sure how this would be a problem as a related Patient must be dereferenced from the RelatedPerson collection of <em>patientRelationship</em> and access controls must be in place whether that Patient reference is one Patient or many; that said, an implementer could constrain the number of patientRelationship entries to 1 only. And I don't see this as comibining things, but rather providing the necessary data structure for relating them to solve a common interoperability problem.</p>
",2777
"===",3581,"2014-09-26 18:57:25.709179+00","<p>
Well, typical behavior is a partially connected network.  Each node is aware of some of the linkages, but few know about all of them.  Where there's any capacity for a ""star""-like behavior, this tends to be managed as a ""Master Patient Index"", where one system maintains a Patient record with knowledge of the identifiers on all subscribing systems.  The authority of this is based on the system, not the nature of the record though.  I.e. You'd still use a Patient record with a bunch of links, it's just that one system would support the coordination of the links.</p>
",105
"===",3581,"2014-09-28 12:47:49.950154+00","<p>
Exactly right. This change is about making that use case possible - where a FHIR-based system needs to coordinate linkages between other systems. It could be an MPI, but doesn't have to be; it could also support a cross-reference of patient identities (like an IHE PIX manager). The RelatedPerson would be the FHIR resource managed by a coordinating system to relate Patient resources ingested from various patient identity domains.</p>

It would be cleaner to do this via a distinct resource than abusing RelatedPerson (which is intended for use in capturing ""next of kin"" and similar relationships, not for linking diverse patient records.  For now, I'd recommend experimenting with Other and presenting your findings to the Patient Administration work group once you think it's ready to introduce as part of the core spec.  That said, it's up to PA to formally rule on this request - they may disagree with me.</p>

Having RelatedPerson and Patient.contact seems redundant and confusing. What if we refractor RelatedPerson to only contain data concerning that person and Patient.contact linking to the resouce?</p>

         &lt;person&gt;&lt;!-- 1..1  Reference(Patient | RelatedPerson) The contact resource --&gt;&lt;/person&gt;<br />

    &lt;photo&gt;&lt;!-- 0..* Attachment Image of the person --&gt;&lt;/photo&gt;<br />
&lt;/RelatedPerson&gt;</p>

<p>
This way, we can use the same RelatedPerson with muliple Patients and Patients can have Patients as their contact person. There will be less duplication of data.</p>
",3137
"===",3581,"2014-10-10 04:21:46.904536+00","<p>
RelatedPerson is to be used when you need to record an actor in some event - who performed something, authored something, consented to something, witnessed something, etc. who wasn't either the patient or a practitioner.  Patient.contact is to capture various roles associated with the patient - who their next of kin are, who their lawyer is, who the owner of an animal is, etc.  The same people won't necessarily be in both places, though they could.</p>

<p>
As well, RelatedPerson is patient-specific.  It's not to capture a generic ""person"".  We have the notion of a Person resource that we may eventually bring back to allow linking various Patient, RelatedPerson and Practitioner records to a single human being for those systems that do that sort of thing, but I think it would be wrong to attempt to make RelatedPerson into that structure.</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that there can be privacy issues with sharing ""relatives"" across patient boundaries.  If one person goes to a ""sensitive"" clinic (abortion, std, etc.) and they find that some of their ""next of kin""/other relatives are already in the system, that can provide significant insight into who else likely has been there.  As well, resource designs should align with common business practices.</p>

<p>
Another note: The information captured for a RelatedPerson isn't necessarily sufficient to identify them as an individual.  You typically won't have date of birth, identifiers or other identity-validation mechanisms.  You'll just have ""Jerry Smith"", father of patient ""John Smith"".  The rigorous identity of the patient allows for robust identification of the related person.  If you strip the patient reference off RelatedPerson, you lose that rigor and start to force systems to have to apply the same sort of identity processes to relatives, care-givers, etc. that they apply to patients.  Forcing that sort of workflow change is inappropriate.</p>

<p>
I would advise to keep Patient, Practioner and RelatedPerson as they are and (when ready), introduce Person as the mechanism to maintain a centralized set of demographics for those systems that support the notion and have the privacy protection mechanism in place to allow it to be used safely.</p>

I think that defining what ""custom"" operations a server supports should be handled by the ""query"" structure.  The ""operation"" structure is intended only for standard REST operations.  On query, everything's clear.  Conformance.rest.query allows you to specify the name (""test"" or ""test1"") as well as the defining uri (""<a href=""http://mycompany.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/test"">http://mycompany.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/test</a>"" vs. ""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/test"">http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/test</a>"").  The problem is that we haven't generified the name to support its use for both queries and operations now that OperationDefinition exists.</p>

Josh: <br />
- I think it's my mistake that the identifier isn't mandatory. Certainly I should have populated in the specification examples<br />- The intention of the redirection in conformance is to allow for the name to be aliased. So in your case, the implementer hosts one operation at $test, and one at $test1, and the clients can even find the name for the opreation they want, if they want to</p>

I wasn't very clear.</p>

<p>
We have a name collision resolution mechanism for search parameters.  All search parameters have a globally unique URI that defines them.  The Conformance resource indicates what parameters will be supported and the ""parameter"" name that will be used in URL for a given search criteria.  This might be different than the ""preferred"" name included in the search criteria definition.</p>

<p>
I think the same approach can (and should) be used for ensuring uniqueness of operation names.  For example, ""translate"" as defined by HL7 might be known as ""translate1"" on a given server, but would still be bound to <a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/translate"">http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/translate</a> in the Conformance statement.</p>

I think the condition approach is wrong. I think that just adding laterality and directionality falls far short of the necessary too.

The specification doesn't provide any grounds for doing this - there's no length limits associated with any of the elements (an implementation specific length limit can be specified in a profile). But I don't think it would be useful to have different types for different lenghts in Java anyway</p>

It is possible for profiles to set maximum lengths for elements, which could help.  And we've talked about using a different type for those elements that support markup (which would tend to be the ultra-long ones).  So I wouldn't dismiss this notion out-of-hand . . .</p>

No issue with needing implementation experience on what's best, but having inconsistency between what the messaging section says and the Conformance section says is just going to confuse implementers.  The specification needs to make its best guess about what's needed and be consistent.  (If we wish, we can add open issues to the spec soliciting feedback about partciular questions.)</p>

One benefit is that right now, we're theoretically vulnerable to a collision between a resource name and a code system name.  The two really should be in separate namespaces.  (Resources live directly in <a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir/X."">http://hl7.org/fhir/X.</a>)</p>

If code systems should not go under a comparable base uri for the reasons stated above: why would you have ValueSets under a different base uri? I.e. by the same reasoning you could leave off ""vs/"" from there too.</p>

<p>
I don't quite see why you would even try to keep code system NullFlavor and value set NullFlavor apart under the same URI as Resources based on name. Code Systems specifically are totally virtual for FHIR right now. There's no resource holding them. You could not retrieve a code system from the given URI.

From Lloyd: </p>

<p>
1. All search parameters are associated with a resource - the resource they are allowed to be used to filter.  There is no use-case for search parameters to ever be associated with a structure other than a resource.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
2. Search criteria can be associated with:</p>

<p>
- extensions</p>

<p>
- core elements that don't have search criteria</p>

<p>
- core elements that do have search criteria, but with differing behavior (e.g. sounds like, ""near"", within 5% of, patient age, etc.)</p>

<p>
- combinations of core elements and/or extensions</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Only for the first of these does tying the search parameter definition to another structure make any sense</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
3. In Conformance, each search parameter needs to be associated with a definition.  If the search criteria live on both ExtensionDefinition and on Profile/Structure, that means there's two different records that can come back.  Furthermore, there would presumably be a 0..* relationship, so they'd have to wade through multiple parameters to find the one that's relevant</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
4. We have equivalent behavior in how Conformance works with OperationDefinition - Conformance lists the name and points to the OperationDefinition that defines the operation for that name.  It will be weird not not behave the same way for Search parameters where Conformance also lists the name and points to the definition</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
5. With your proposal, the same sort of information and documentation lives in two different places.  In mine, it lives in one.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
6. Search parameter definitions are independently identifiable (they have to be for Conformance to point to them) and are at least as independently maintainable as multiple extensions that are defined in the same context.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
7. You haven't provided one reason why search parameters should be tied to any structure other than a resource</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
8. It's not clear  how having SearchParameterDefinition as a distinct resource creates any significant increased burden on implementers.  </p>

Animal itself isn't in the 80%.  However, we made a conscious decision to include it anyhow - to make explicit that FHIR supports veterinary medicine.  If the notion of animal is in, then the notion of ""is this an animal or human"" has to be in, including dealing with the fact that some systems might not know.</p>
",105
"===",3655,"2014-10-27 09:51:21.439735+00","<p>I'd have thought that in these cases where it is an animal but don't know the type, then would want to use an ""unkown"" value or similar from the value set that would be included (even though the example set doesn't have one).

Well, the issue is that humans know it's an animal (because they can read the text comment) but the computer not only doesn't know what kind of animal it is but also doesn't know whether it's an animal at all.  The computer can't differentiate whether it's an animal or a human.  Most of the time it deals with humans, but the odd animal gets thrown in and there's no discrete element that tells the computer that.</p>

<p>
So the problem is that we're using the presence or absence of the ""animal"" element to indicate whether the Patient is human.  If I don't send ""animal"" then that means ""this instance is definitely human"".  If I send ""animal"" (regardless of what I put inside it), then that means ""this instance is definitely not a human"".  But there's no way for a computer to say ""I deal with both humans and non-humans and I can't say definitively which this particular patient happens to be"".</p>

<p>
What I think we need is to stop using the presence or absense of ""animal"" to determine whether someone is a human or not.  If we had a boolean or a code, then it'd be possible to convey ""unknown"".  We could make the presence of ""animal"" conditional on the value of the boolean/code.</p>

It would have to be a modifierExtension.  And I think it's dangerous to declare a default in the instance and expect systems where the default doesn't apply to discover and then use a modifierExtension.  I don't think failing to have a discrete value that flags an instance as being human vs. animal will be that uncommon.  As Grahame pointed out, support for distinguishing that in v2 didn't show up until 2.3.1 or later.  Systems designed primarily for humans could easily handle distinguishing using text in most cases, which doesn't help in determining whether to include Patient.animal.</p>

Changing to a codeable concept and value set sounds potentially useful, but probably alone isn't going to be sufficient.  For at least the ""sorted by priority"" and ""sorted by category"" options that Grahame mentioned (and likely others), you would have to have an additional mechanism of some kind to define how the priority or category applies to each item.  A simple means of grouping might be sufficient (at least for the 80%), but you would have to have some means available for doing that.  At present that would likely need to be an extension?  The other listed options probably could be handled by a code, so making that change could still be useful.  I agree that this is a code system that we would undoubtedly have to define.  The listed options could be a reasonable starter set of example codes.  Maybe the value set is ""sort options"" (shorter and simpler than ""sort parameter values"" or something like that)?  The example codes could begin with Grahame's list, modified to remove the ""sorted by"" (which would be implicit):</p>

<p>
user<br />
system<br />
event date<br />
entry date<br />
priority<br />
alphabetic<br />
catgeory<br />
patient</p>

<p>
I've left ""priority"" and ""category"" in the list for future consideration, as I do think they require an additional mechanism in order to support them.  No specific additional options have come to my mind at the moment, but likely we can come up with some others that would be useful.  Obviously they all would need adequate definitions for their intended use in this context, as Lloyd has pointed out.</p>

Agree that if this is baked into the infrastructure it shouldn't be an extension. But I'm far from convinced that mixing things like this is sensible.

This was done because of how implementers feel about context and containment. It's possible to explain that you can't have context between modular resources because of the independent access problem. But explaining why not to allow it inside a resource - when there's no access problem - is quite hard. And implementers will do this anyway, really, So it makes sense to allow it, even though it is still potentially dangerous. We could make the language stronger, I guess (though I thought that pointing out that their meaning might not be consistent might be enough)</p>

How about this: ""FHIR provides no mechanism for defining or constraining any conduction of ""equivalent"" properties from a containing resource into any contained resource - not even by declaring the use of a particular profile.</p>

<p>
Best practice is to explicitly include all known properties on contained resources, even if redundant with properties on the containing resource.  E.g. If the containing resource and contained resource both have a ""subject"" element, both elements should be present, even if they reference the same resouce.  Servers that choose to omit redundant elements on contained resources should not expect clients to infer (or correctly infer) conducted semantics.  Clients cannot safely presume that omitted elements in contained resources can safely be inferred to be the same as the containing resource.  Any attempt to optimize resource content by 'conducting' meaning from containing to contained resources must be managed through out-of-band agreement and must be done with the recognition that any receiver not party to that agreement may not make correct (or any) inferences.""</p>

I agree with option 2. This is really about state transitions for a given resource, and what actions an actor in a particular workflow can take given the resource's current state. Versions of the underlying resources should be immutable. And properties that describe the state of a resource should be ""read-only"".</p>

<p>
The use of the word ""activity"" in the details of this request suggest the need for application protocols associated with particular resources and cannonical workflows. Reading the workflow descriptions from the related listserv thread, it seems to me that it would be valuable for WGs to provide input on what is necessary to transition the state of a resource through a workflow - transition a DiagnosticOrder from proposed to planned, for example. Here you need to convey information about the licensed physician who signs the order and any other data relevant to activation.

""the udi string will be in the identifier or type depending on it's purpose"" - how can an end-user or collecting system know which purpose it is? That's a terrible decision, and I think it's a real bad idea. </p>

I don't understand why there'd be a donor identification number. Who cares who donated a device?</p>

<p>The definition of manufactured date is the date when the device was manufactured. This is captured in a variety of ways on device barcodes - note this would only be used when there is no udi.</p>

- This decision requires that everyone who engages with UDI parse and process the UDI, irrespective of whether that's relevant to their use case - they can't just collect it for some other system to use it. I still think it's a terrible decision</p>

- what does ""manufactured"" mean? the date the design was done, the date the device was shipped as a kit, the date the kit was assembled? I do not think that this is actually obvious. And now, to use this field, you have to know whether there's a UDI? What kind of madness is this? </p>

- It's totally irrelevant whether the v3 device class covers things that come from biological donors, At present, this is outside the scope of the Device resource, and we haven't dicussed how it fits into FHIR.

If Person gets introduced, it should be optional.  Many systems would still support only Patient and Practitioner.  And Patient and Practitioner would still have their own demographics.  Systems that supported Person could choose to auto-update the linked Patient, Practitioner and/or RelatedPerson records when the Person was updated.  (Or in some cases, to update Person when an update was submitted to Patient, Practitioner or RelatedPerson.)  I.e. FHIR shouldn't force the notion of a Person registry, it should merely support the existence of one for those that need one.</p>

Lloyd - yes, agree on all counts. FHIR should support Person registry, optionality and that Person should imply no constraints on custodianship of Person data. If used, an implementation could synchronize data between related Person-Patient, or Person-Practitioner, etc. resources. That's one use case. Person, as distinct from Patient, does support a system that allows an actor (the individual, as one example) to manage an individual's demographic data as seperate from what might be stored in a particular patient registration system. </p>

The Person resource is not necessary to control access.  Keep in mind that neither Person nor Patient (or any of the others) function as a ""User"" resource in terms of someone who logs on and has permissions.  That's handled separately.  Once ""logged in"", the user is tied to a particular Patient or Practitioner or RelatedPerson role in terms of capturing who did what (author, Provenance information, etc.)  The Person resource *would* (in theory) allow linking multiple Patient records together and thus allowing consent wishes expressed against one Patient resource to be propagated to other linked Patient records, but this would be business process-specific - it wouldn't be safe to presume this would automatically happen.</p>

I agree we should yank Money, etc. as types and use them instead as profiles.  I think distinguishing between data type and resource is useful because it implies a significant difference in the semantics of the extension.  Resource contexts are limited to specific defined paths.  Data type contexts can appear all over the place (including in new elements not yet invented).</p>

<p>documentationSignature: Purpose to determine if content altered over time regarless of movement, should not break if moved. Operation: sign over immutable portions of current resource, and follow references in the order encountered and include either: if the referred to resource has a documentation signature include the documentational signature string if any (more efficient than harvesting the SignedHash from the string) and do not follow references for this resource; if the referred to resource does not then include the immutable elements from the referred to resource and follow the references for this resource applying this same logic as you go.</p>

Agree that we should add a page focused on digital signature issues. Comments on specific issues:</p>

<p>
&gt; Advice is needed for how to create a Provenance.signature and how to validate one so that the signature survives various movements. Or do we just indicate that signatures are not intended to survive movements?</p>

<p>
The purpose of provenance signatures should be prescribed to not protect against movements. Or better, we should say that digital signatures apply at a are point in time and space.</p>

<p>
&gt; * How are signatures to be handled by a receiving system that imports the resource for use? That is it encorporates the resource content, and likely fixes up the References to local copies of the resource?</p>

<p>
updates the references as required. This means that a client cannot sign content where the server is allocating the identities. This doesn't seen especially surprising. I think we should define a system level operation for pre-allocating identities to ease this problem. </p>

<p>
&gt; ** Should a counter-signature be used? That is the importing system will validate the incoming signature, and then counter sign the fixedup resource, which should be a new version with a new Provenance.</p>

<p>
I think there's a role for a counter signature. We should mention the possibility in the signature page</p>

<p>
&gt; * How to handle when References are included in the resource being signed?</p>

<p>
Provenance can sign more than one resource at a time. may wish to sign the whole group</p>

<p>
&gt; ** Do they get turned into relative URLs?</p>

<p>
no. they are as they are. </p>

<p>
&gt; *** If a system imports the resource and 'fixes up' the References to point at local copies of the referenced resource, then the signatures will fail to validate</p>

<p>
yes. indeed. anything else would be wrong, surely. </p>

<p>
&gt; ** Do they get turned into just the unique part, without the URL root?</p>

<p>
that might not be unique then </p>

<p>
&gt; ** How are versioned Referenced resources identified?</p>

<p>
version specific reference, if desired</p>

<p>
&gt; ** Do you seralize the Referenced resource along with the resource? If so how deep?</p>

<p>
Don't understand this question</p>

<p>
&gt; * How to handle metadata?</p>

<p>
we should have a canonicalization method that allows you to sign narrative + data (default), narrative + data + meta, narrative, or data</p>

<p>
&gt; ** Which metadata is included in the signature? Which is not?</p>

<p>
all or none, see previous</p>

<p>
&gt; * How are signatures to be handled when the resource server gets re-located, changing the URL root?</p>

<p>
non relative signatures are broken. How else could it work? </p>

<p>
<br />
Comments on Paul's notes:<br />
* integritySignatures - well, ok, but ""transit"" isnt quite a fitting term for how it would be used in either a provenance resource or a bundle. But yes, it's fundementally fragile<br />
* documentation signature - I think it's more extensive that just 'if moved"" - if people add translations to codes, does that break the signature? if people add audit trail information, does it change? if date stamps change, is it different? each use case is different. I believe that the only way to deal with this is to describe specific canonicalisation methods for each use case, and check the signature after the canonicalisation has been used to produce a bundle. We could define an example in the signatures page</p>

I'm thinking of people who aren't using a FHIR specific client library, since an out of the box HTTP library would probably assume ISO-8859-1 if it doesn't see a charset on a textual payload.</p>

<p>
E.g. Apache HttpClient lets you access the response body as either a Java InputStream or a Reader. If a programmer picks the former they get to pick the charset (so no problem) but if they choose the latter the HTTP library would pick for them and would probably pick wrong, absent an explicit declaration.

I'm sure many/most do, but OTOH that's not something you usualy have to worry about when writing textual HTTP clients since people pretty much always specify a charset.</p>

I'm not suggesting that there is something fundamentally wrong with the idea of this proposal, but I think it introduces client complexity in a way, and opens a potential for bugs.. Charsets are one of those things where bugs creep in because it works fine in your test environment until the first non-english word shows up in your production environment.</p>

OperationDefinition allows operations and queries to be defined as being against a single resource (or multiple resources).  Defining this in Conformance.rest.resource would mean that there'd be two different ways of declaring what resource(s) an operation can be invoked against.  This would be redundant and would also open the possibility for inconsistency.  Moving the specification of the relevant resource to Conformance from OperationDefinition would be problematic because the resource(s) supported is an intrinsic part of the definition of the operation.  (E.g. requesting an ""expansion"" on anything other than ValueSet would be nonsensical)</p>

Indication wouldn't be a care plan or a trial or protocol - that would be the fulfills.  Fulfills says ""what in the workflow caused me to do this"".  Indication says ""what in the patient caused me to do this""  Procedure is a bit iffy because it could be workflow-related, but it could also be that the procedure caused an issue which caused an encounter and the issue is just omitted.  Not sure that'd be in the 80% though and would likely be handled by a code rather than a link to the offending Procedure.</p>

from core principles:</p>

<p>
Coded With Extensibility (CWE) means that the set of codes resolved from the Value Set Assertion is not necessarily complete for its intended use-case. There may be some concepts that need to be communicated that cannot be represented within the Value Set Assertion enumeration. Implementers therefore have permission to send local codes or original text within the coded element if an appropriate code cannot be found within the resolved Value Set Assertion. There is, however, an expectation on implementers to feed back these ""missing concepts"" to the maintainers of the Value Sets or referenced Code System(s) to have the necessary concept added and to transition to the 'official' code when one is added.</p>

<p>
Coded with No Extensibility (CNE) means that the Value Set Version is considered to be complete. Use of local codes or free text is not permitted within non-null coded elements bound to the Value Set Assertion. (Local codes and free text can still be used if the coded element has a null flavor of OTH – Other.)</p>

Well, in the future, there will be hundreds (or more likely thousands) of IGs and profiles published by a diverse set of groups.  We can point to these via the registries, but I don't know how practical it will be to include links to all of them in the FHIR core spec.  (Right now we're including links to a few IGs because those are actually published as part of the FHIR spec, but that's only a temporary solution until the tooling is sufficient to allow them to be published independently.)</p>

<p>
I've moved this to be an FMG issue - we need to figure out what our policy will be and mechanism(s) will be around linking to/advertising/endorsing profiles and IGs produced by others.  (I'm not opposed to referencing the IHE IGs, I just don't want us to set a precedent without thinking things through first.)</p>

isn't accepted = completed? I think that this means that existing status codes are too abstract and should be more domain specific</p>

completed = The referral has been completely actioned.</p>

<p>
In most workflows there's a step between sent and active. The referral is generally transmitted (SENT), then acknowledged by the recipient but they can't start work on it right away so it is in a queue of things to do (ACCEPTED). When work is started on the referral, ie. in progress, the referral is ACTIVE and when the referral has been completely actioned, the work is COMPLETED.</p>

<p>
I think the statuses are pretty universally applicable. eg. FHIR change requests --&gt; Someone drafts them (DRAFT), then submits them (SENT). You then triage them and say yep its a valid request but can't assign someone to work on it yet so it's got the status ACCEPTED. When someone starts work on it it's ACTIVE, and when the change has been made is COMPLETED.</p>

<p>
There was a bit of a discussion about this on the implementers channel:</p>

<p>
[26/11/2014 10:06:16 am] Brian Postlethwaite: what about an accepted status?<br />
[26/11/2014 10:06:56 am] Brian Postlethwaite: (which is the converse of refused)<br />
[26/11/2014 10:07:13 am] Andrew Yap: either name works for me. accepted || acknowledged. i just thought it was missing in the workflow: draft --&gt; sent --&gt; accepted || acknowledged --&gt; active --&gt; completed<br />
[26/11/2014 10:08:28 am] Brian Postlethwaite: acknowledged just seems more like the system has received the request, but has not been processed. (messaging paradigm)<br />
[26/11/2014 10:09:12 am] Andrew Yap: @brian: you're right. accepted implies a person has changed the status<br />
[26/11/2014 10:09:13 am] Brett Esler: agree - it is more like a promise of care rather than just got the message</p>

I disagree with the explanation behind the question. </p>

<p>
Having a base means that the profile is relative to another definition. So resource and data type profiles don't (or shouldn't) have a base, and anything else should. Inline elements don't have a profile of their own. </p>
",150
"===",3873,"2014-12-16 18:48:47.41126+00","<p>
Agreed. What I meant is that this is not visible when looking at the individual elements. Taking alert.profile.json as an example, there is the element with ""path"": ""Alert"" and the element with ""path"": ""Alert.meta"". Neither defines what they are, you have to know that the former defines the resource found in the profile and the latter is merely an inline defined element.</p>

<p>
That is what I meant would be nice to state explicitly so that an element's identity is clear when looking at it. Minor thing.</p>

",150
"===",3873,"2015-01-15 16:11:25.753895+00","<p>
From the ballot:</p>

<p>
A profile extending another profile/resource must define a parent base and a differential section that defines the extension (optionally with the snapshot element).  This makes sense.</p>

<p>
However, the differential for core resource profiles (e.g. Immunization, Procedure, etc.) is entirely duplicating the snapshot element. This is mostly an artifact of the profile generation and publishing tools rather than the FHIR spec but the spec (e.g. profile section 6.17) should clearly differentiate between top-level profiles (those with no base) and those with a base.</p>

<p>
From Grahame:</p>

need to consider this. I think there's a better solution, to split out definitions and profiles. Relationship between Extensiondefinition, DataElement and Profile needs to be reconsidered</p>

<p>
3) N<strong>eed explain what that means when no comparator is used ( ie if empty assume &gt;  for .low and assume &lt; for .high ) </strong></p>

NamingSystem's purpose is to tie multiple identifiers together and to capture a great deal of information about a particular identifier.  There is no ""canonical"" id.  If you see two namespaces with active identifiers with the same value, it's relatively safe to assume they're referring to the same thing - and it doesn't matter who created the record.</p>

<p>
Profile, ExtensionDefinition, SearchParameter, OperationDefinition and ValueSet all need to be resolvable at runtime, so it makes sense that they're all URIs.  (making the OperationDefinition name consistent would be good).  ConceptMap and COnformance aren't referenced at runtime, so breaking the pattern is probably ok.</p>

I don't really see the benefit of this. Does it really matter? If you search for 'harlem', does it matter whether it's in city or just the text? if an application declines to search text why make the client do something different in the API? nor do I follow why you wouldn't want to search non-residential addresses. Inhernetly, searching addresses is a person level thing to because of looseness in the address (unless there's delivery point id, or this is a postal system itself, in which case there'll be extensions etc)</p>

<p>I believe, however, that it very unlikely that a healthcare-based client application is going to design an input box labeled ""address"" where a user would put in whatever information they want (city, postal code, street address lines,etc.). Map/almanac applications do this but they server a specific purpose which is not directly related to healthcare.</p>

<p>Every client application I've ever seen has a separate field for city vs. state/region vs. street address lines vs. postal code.</p>

<p>We're creating more unnecessary work for a server to send over a query parameter that is simply labeled ""address"". The server then theorertically then has to search each separate field in its database. Also, it doesn't allow the server to define matching behavior separately for the postalCode vs the street address lines. e.g. you may want to support partial matching for street address lines but only support exact matching for postal code.</p>

<p>
""When resources are returned as part of a bundle (e.g. see <a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/http.html#search"">search</a> below), the server should return the ETag value as an attribute named ""etag"" in the FHIR namespace (""<a href=""http://hl7.org/fhir"">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>"") on the <strong>feed.entry</strong> element (or, for JSON, a property ""etag"" on the feed.entry object).""</p>

I sure don't implement it that way either. Is this saying severs need to be aware of subsumption/equivalence relationships in the underlying codesystem?  I would love this to be (as Josh and I implemented it) just based on direct comparisons, since that's otherwise a big burden on servers where this function will in most cases just be used to filter males and females on simple flat codesystems.</p>

This would implicitly add more complexity to search in that a single search parameter could have multiple modifiers now. Not saying it is impossible.</p>

As far as syntax goes: also wondering whether this is a modifier. We changed modifiers like :before and :after to use comparison syntax instead (=&gt; and =&lt;), so this might be =! instead for example. </p>

What I did in my implementation is: do preprocessing on the instance first, to preprare it for use in this kind of frameworks. Their capabilities differ, so a preprocessing step to prepare it for the specific framework is sensible. I combine ""element"" and ""_element"" back into a single element too. It's a trivial transform, and for now allows the serialized json form to be as concise as it is.</p>

PHI or PII can end up in the logs anyway. There's no rule that the logs can only log the URL, and not the body. And if they're logging the requests, they'll be logging the responses as well. So it's not that different. Actually, the reason for indutry practice not to put things in the URL is bceause they can show up in the browser type ahead. </p>

In a healthcare application, either you trust things, or you do not. So I find this quite unpersuasive</p>

I agree with Grahame. The threat of web-server logs is very minimal. The web-server is handling a large amount of PHI, not just the URL. It must be properly configured, and all data that is sensitive must be appropriately protected.</p>

<p>
Further the communications path needs to be equally protected for POST or GET; so it must be covered by HTTPS and likely client authenticated with something like OAuth.</p>

<p>
The browser cache is likely a bigger concern, but even here there are controls that can be used to assure that the cache is flushed at the end of a session.</p>

<p>
Rather than forbid something, I would accept that we need to do a better job of explaining that this 'risk' exists, and guide implementers to address the risk in operational and deployment controls.</p>

Lloyd - when actually editing this xpath for the change to list, I don't understand it at all. So let's start with a plain english statement of the xpath:<br /><br />
- it the composition is in a bundle with type document<br />
- the section content references must point within in teh bundle (either #local, or by base)<br />
- and the things the references point to must be lists with List.text.div existing</p>

So, there's part of the path that's bogus - it says to not check for a match if there's a full URL - which of course shouldn't occur because a full URL could be a local reference.  So that part can be dropped.</p>

<p>
The next part checks to see if the section points to a contained resource and, if so, ensures the containe resource has a narrative.  That bit works.  (Though we might want to enforce that the status says something other than ""no content"").</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the next bit doesn't work anymore because we need to take into account the ""base"" for both the Composition resource (which affects references) and for the referenced resoruces (which affects their ids).  And the fact that base can appear at two different levels.  The resulting number of combinations of possibilities would create an xpath from hell.  We *really* need to figure out away to allow xpath-based id matching.</p>

you can do that.

<p>My concern is that ""Orders"" are things that are typically privileged operations.  Lots of healthcare professionals aren't allowed to create ""Orders"".  And it's also going to make people think the topic is narrower than it is.  I just want to confirm that when they're voting, the work groups understand that this resource will cover everything that falls under INT in v3 - so lab promises, decision support recommendations, care plan stuff, etc. </p>
",2711
"===",5162,"2015-03-12 19:21:31.019246+00","<p>
The language of DiagnosticRequest, NutritionRequest, etc. still does not sound quite right to me.  I think it might end up being less clear and more confusing than helpful.  On the other hand, having a more general ""Request"" resource (not sure if that would be the right name) that covers the scope of ""everything that falls under INT in v3 - so lab promises, decision support recommendations, care plan stuff, etc."", as Lloyd said, would seem potentially reasonable.  Maybe that's where things that didn't fit into DiagnosticOrder, NutritionOrder, etc. could go?  <br /><br />
The V3 RQO UsageNote discussion does appear to be germane here:</p>

<p>
The concepts of a ""request"" and an ""order"" are viewed as different, because there is an implication of a mandate associated with order. In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care computing. ""Orders"" are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a ""request"" obligates the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author). Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe, the common term used is ""request.""</p>

<p>
Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made. If a mandate is to be associated with a request, this will be embodied in the ""local"" business rules applied to the transactions. Should HL7 desire to provide a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.<br /><br />
So I might be persuaded that changing to the use of ""request"" rather than ""order"" is a reasonable step to take, as long as we do it consistently.</p>

"===",5185,"2015-01-21 00:09:27.416019+00","<p>From a purely technical perspective, it seems like a &lt;Link&gt; element within an ATOM feed with a rel value of ""self"" would do the trick (RFC 4287).</p>

<p>Let's assume, however, for a moment that Patient/Person is just a special use case that needs to be accounted for. I think that it is important to consider who is going to be doing the linking of disparate patient resources. I'm extremely skeptical that this would be healthcare providers. Rather, I believe that the patient or a proxy for the patient would do any and all linking. They would do so via the key identifiers that the organization provides to them e.g. log-in username/id. To meet the aggregation use case, it seems like the resource should be something more along the lines of ""Account List"" vs. ""Person"". The ""Account List"" resource would track the organizations (and/or FHIR Servers) where the patient has information. It would also then include key information that facilitates the linking (which wouldn't necessarily be demographics).</p>

MnM review: We use different mechanisms based on use-case.  For ""master person indexes"", having a Person resource makes sense.  For terminologies, we have ConceptMap.  For some resources, there may be an explicit ""replaces"" relationship.  We can also define equivalences via extension, etc.  It doesn't appear that we can (or should) attempt to apply a one size fits all solution.  Balloter has asked for more discussion within PA.</p>

I would like to pull 5273. My comment was found not persuasive, but I don't understand why. I did not say that Imaging ""Reports"" should be observations. I said ""imaging data"" (perhaps I should have said ""imaging results"" instead). My comment referenced section 4.21.7. Specifically, I looked at the XML for the DXA Bone Densitometry imaging example.<br /><a href=""http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/diagnosticreport-example-dxa.xml.html"">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/diagnosticreport-example-dxa.xml.html</a><br /><br />

<p>
The word ""diagnostic"" would, to clinicians, encompass many types of observations, and I thought that my proposed wording change included extra examples that were within the scope of observations, and would bring more clarity. Since the main objection to my comment seemed to be ""imaging reports"" I hope this email clarifies that I did not intend for a ""report"" to be an ""observation"" but was referring to granular data such as the bone density data shown above.</p>

The resource doesn't represent the physical thing.  It represents the request for and provision of the physical thing.  The description needs to reflect what the resource does.  (I'll admit I'm a bit uncomfortable with this resource which seems to merge the request and response aspects into a single structure.  Curious whether that reflects general business patterns.)</p>

Hello</p>

<p>
I think it would introduce big variations (i.e. it is not clear) this resouce if we say it is the ""request for something, and provision of what is supplied. I think a Supply Request has different constraints (types of entities mentioned) than one Supply Response (assuming that is what is meant with provision). Using a same resource creates a gap in implementation that will create hugely varying implementations, while all still compatible with the first version of standard. Patching it would be very difficult.</p>

<p>
I think the issue (pointing to the item supplied) shows this lack of clarity.</p>

<p>
Suggestion 1: Show the requirements and use cases that this resource was designed for. Or review these concepts considering the ongoing work across SDOs.</p>

<p>
Suggestion 2: (at least) Clarify a way to separate the request from the response. And exclude the status.</p>

Hello</p>

<p>
I think both wordings create an unnecessary complexity - using a supply resource or a medication resource.</p>

<p>
Is there a resource for ""medication physical product"" . i.e. the specific physical item, with expiry date, and lot number? a physical item is very different from a ""medication"", in that inventory and quantities (intrinsically part of any supply aspects) have to do with the product, not with the ""class"" or"" medication.</p>

<p>
I think the best way to address this would be ""The supply order uses a medication or medical device _type_ resource (or a general product type container described in this resource)"", and a supply response uses a ""medication"" /""medical device physical product"" or a physical product type described in this resource"".</p>

<p>
This would be an easy change and should be compliant with the other SDOs.</p>

<p>
Suggestion: Rediscuss the structure of this resource based on a concrete set of requirements or use cases with IHE (evt others).</p>

I see in clinicalAssessment Resource you have the following - </p>

<p>
Order - A specific order that lead to this assessment</p>

<p>
Rationale: when nurses implement an order, we do an assessment first to ensure that the indication for the order is appropriate (we don't just do the order). For example - start patient on full liquid diet post op day 2. the nurse will assess the patient for bowel sounds, free of nausea and vomiting, and assess if the patient will be able to tolerate the full liquid diet (i.e. the patient is tolerating the current diet before implementing the full liquid diet). Or, start wet-to-dry dressing - nurses will assess the wound and make sure there is a need for the order (indication is appropriate) before we implement the order. We need to be able to document the assessment and say why we did the assessment. </p>

The signature in provenance is there to prove that the resource has not changed from the intended resource which the provenance describes. This is just one use of a digital signature.</p>

<p>
It would be inappropriate to use a provenance resource to do a signature like a signature for the purpose of Reviewed&amp;Approve, OverRead, Co-Sign, etc.</p>

<p>
So the approach is to create a signature resource that can be used for any purpose. In this resource we would expose who, when, why, as more easily accessible; although the non-repudiatable versions of these are within the signature block.  This signature would be similar to Provenance but not limited to ""Provenance"". It is possible that Provenance is changed to point at this Signature resource (Guidance welcome).</p>

<p>
Alternative is that we relax what we mean by Provenance, and change Provenance to something more like Evidence (likely need to cast that, as the single word evidence will be confusing in healthcare), or Lifecycle (record lifecycle events).</p>

Before worrying about the specific ids, I'd like us to define the rules for what can go into the vocabulary.  At minimum, we should include the following:</p>

<p>
* Any codes added need to be universal in scope - nothing limited to a single country or region</p>

<p>
* All codes need to be orthogonal - there must be no chance that a single identifier could be interpretted as falling withing multiple codes</p>

<p>
* Codes need to fall within the 80% of identifier types for at least one kind of resource.  I.e. 80% of systems using that resource would support using that type of identifier for that type of resource</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
All other codes would need to be handled by the ""extensible"" aspect of the binding.  If you want something finer grained, you would need to send the general ""international"" code as well as the more specific local code.</p>

FHIR Terminology add ""incomplete"" and ""example"" bindings without defining them or relating them to ""dynamic"" or ""reference"" value sets. My suggestion was that if the FHIR terminology specification is relating new concepts (""incomplete"" and ""example"") to existing and painstakingly defined vocab concepts it would be easier for implementers to adopt. I believe the Core Principles is referenced in the FHIR frontmatter but I could be wrong on that score. At any rate, it would be useful to reuse the definitions and concepts already defined even of we choose to use some and ignore others.</p>

Vocab agreed with changing the name to ""selectedExplicitly"", but ran into problems with the definition of the element itself. Is it when you pick a 'code' directly? or when you pick the concept directly? When do you actually pick the code directly?<br />
- use the preferred display<br />- use a display from the code system?<br />
- use a traslation to a different language from a national distribution?<br />
- use an alternative locally provided display? </p>

But maybe you don't even need this element anyway - if you have original text, what does this element give you? Maybe it should be defined to just selecting the actual code? But then the text would be the code.... </p>

This refers to section 6.14.3.5, where the conformance and extensibility properties of binding definitions are defined. If Conformance isn't Required, then extensibility seems to make no difference.

I thought that we were going to combine the HL7 v3 signature types and the ASTM types.</p>

<p>
The ASTM types are commonly used in Healthcare usecases that utalize Digital Signatures. Precident setting found in IHE-DSG use.</p>

<p>
Note the ASTM signature purposes are those used in the CDA Digital Signature and Delegation of Rights specification.</p>

<p>
Lastly, in order to be used in XML-Signature they must be fully qualfied using a URI. So we would  need to show how that is done with these codes</p>

"===",5391,"2015-03-15 18:28:44.121987+00","<p>
The ASTM Signature purpose codes have been updated with the definitions from the ASTM specification.</p>

<p>
It is not clear to me how the 'hl7 v3 role code' apply to a signature purpose. I understand how a role is used in the participation on an act. but the meaning of the signature is still going to be one of the ASTM signature purpose codes.</p>

<p>
If the HL7 v3 role codes are still needed, then we should add them as an alternative vocabulary on Signature.type. We would need to cast them into signature purpose, rather than role. There is no need for the core FHIR specification to constrain these vocabularies to just the ASTM vocabulary, but rather allow any legitimate signature purpose.</p>

<p>
Is the ""Agreed Change"" fully enclusive of the codes from HL7 v3?</p>

There is however a need to explain how the HL7 v3 codes would be used in the XML-Signature XAdES ""CommitmentTypeIndication"" which is of type ""URI"". This should be resolved before additional codes are allowed.</p>

On the afternoon meeting on Feb 17th, it was determined that Provenance.agent.reference should be similarly defined as SecurityEvent.participant.reference. Thus the reference is pointing to one of the FHIR resource types that can act to create content. E.g. Organizations, Providers, Patients, Device, ...</p>

I think making FHIR's ""http operations"" (update, delete, read) explicit in transaction bundles would improve the understandability of the spec, and actually make it easier to implement consistently. The same logic would apply in an bundle as for a bunch of http operations. (An added bonus, which would address a use case I've heard from many corners: we could support ""read"" and ""vread"" in transaction bundles, as well, which would allow more effecient execution of multiple reads.)</p>

<p>
I'm not sure about extending this beyond FHIR's ""http operations"", but I really do think it's worth considering. I don't believe this adds to the complexity: by defining a trivial mapping between fhir ""http operations"" (and possible FHIR Operations, too) and transaction bundle entries, server-side logic becomes directly re-usable.</p>

There's no question this needs to be done, however it's going to require a good chunk of tooling time to get it done properly.  And that's not going to happen in time for DSTU 2.  We've now got 4-5 examples of what a FHIR IG could look like (and they're not really *that* all over the map).  Prior to the third major release, we want to refactor the tooling to support independent publication of IGs.  And we might choose to initiate a project to draft a ""best practices"" guide for at least DSTU status at that point.</p>

<p>Amended Proposed Wording:<br />
There are many sources of possible codes for device type. The example suggests to use device codes from RTM. Another source which will be appropriate for many devices is the local UDI repository (in the US this is the GUDID database)-- the device identifier (DI) or GMDN code could be used for Device.type. A full UDI string (without a serial number) can also be stored in the Device.type element. (see below) or equivalent. Alternatively, many jurisdictions have their own supply chain arrangements which define many useful codes.</p>

<p>Actually I think we need to review this again: If we could drop the 'is it an identifier or a type' thinking and just put it in its own element then the location becomes constant. Then the DI or some other value could be placed in the type for a simple and unburdened type code.</p>

<p>Amended Proposed Wording:<br />
 The most important of the identifiers is the Unique Device Identifier (UDI). The UDI has 2 components -- the device identifier (DI), which is assigned at the version/model level of the device and the production identifier(s)(PI) which provide the means to track a device through its manufacture, distribution and use. The UDI string may aslo contain additonal elements which are not formally part of the local defined UDI elements but which are non the less contained within the same string and are of value locally. The DI of the UDI may be stored in a jurisdictional respository and used as the primary key to access other device information. The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely (when the PI(s) include a serial number), or it may just identify the type of the device. The UDI can be broken into its constituent parts (DI, PI and other elements) by parsing rules developed by each Issuing Agency standard. Where the device has an assigned UDI, the other details carried in the resource (e.g. lot, expiry date etc) SHALL be consistent with the information encoded in the UDI string or registered in the GUDID.</p>

<p>In the US, a UDI will be required by the FDA for every medical device to bear on its label (unless excepted). The DI of the UDI is submitted in a device record to the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) and is used as the primary key to access other device information.<br />

Note that a GTIN (sometimes also called an EAN number) is a code devekloped by GS1 for the kind of device  not an identifier for the device. A GTIN may appear on its own or it may appear in a UDI string as the DI component. The UDIs which contain a serial number are store in the 'identifier' element while UDIs which do not contain a serial number are stored in the 'type' element.</p>

<p>Note: for OO committee review</p>

<p>1) when a GTIN is the only barcoide content will it always be logged to the GUDID registry? If not then the GTIN should use the GS1 supplied OID and this case should be removed from the HL7 UDI Harmonization Pattern Document, otherwise it may use the instruction in the HL7 UDI Harmonization Pattern Document.</p>

We should distinguish from navigation, which is a very robust and dynamic capability, from the official URL that the source declares. This is especially true of http vs https; as many navigations would allow starting at the http and redirecting to https.</p>

<p>
I am less clear on the portnumber; but would hope that it is more considered part of the connection information, as is the hostname. This is less clear as persisting a URL persists both.</p>

<p>The portion of the url after the protocol is particular to the object including the specication of ports: While <a href=""http://machine"">http://machine</a> and <a href=""http://machine"">http://machine:80</a> may be equivalent, for FHIR they are not considered identical due to the prevalence of port mapping.

And actually, the onus is on the WG to demonstrate to at least some degree of confidence that the vast majority of systems that support any type of consents are capable of capturing every single one of these data elements.  In cases of uncertainty, we err on the side of making things an extension rather than core for the DSTU period.  I've seen a couple of Canadian systems and they didn't do more than the above.  (And the type, organization and text weren't actually captured on the grounds that they were fixed based on context, though I think it's reasonable to expect these to be explicit in FHIR.)</p>

The SDC, DAF and other questionnaires are realm and context-specific.  They can include whatever they like.  However, the Consent profile is similar to the forthcoming Immunization profile.  It's essentially constrained to resource rules - it must be context neutral - it has to apply to every country in the world, every type of consent in the world and needs to, as much as possible, reflect what existing systems do now, not necessarily what we think they ought to do.  Also note that SDC makes *significant* use of extensions to cover a lot of its functionality.  Almost half of the data elements in the Questionnaire profile are extensions.</p>

<p>
The 80% has nothing to do with what's optional.  If we don't think the vast majority of systems capture something, then it shouldn't be included in the profile at all.  (You can define common extensions for those elements if you wish.)  We don't use resources or resource-level profiles to define best practice or even good practice.  That's left to more refined profiles (e.g. the genomics profile on FamilyHistory).</p>

<p>
Note: 80% isn't dogma.  It's a core principle of FHIR.  It is somewhat subjective, but not terribly.  Most WGs have found very few elements where there was dispute when they focused on the question of ""how many of the wide variety of systems that currently do what this resource does support this functionality right now?"". If you can point to systems in multiple jurisdictions with different cultures and multiple types of consent that all support the element and don't have a lot of counter-examples of systems that support consent but don't support the element, that's fine for 80%.  Where work groups tend to struggle is when they believe systems *should* do something but don't currently and they're reluctant to handle that as an extension.  The FHIR approach in such situations is to define it as an extension during the DSTU period (and maybe create a ""good practice"" profile that uses the extension) and to see what implementer uptake is during the DSTU period.</p>

<p>As for SDC - there are only a few extensions and as far as I know US systems now do what that FHIR IG and profiles on FHIR Questionnaire/QuestionnaireAnswer Resources. I think we need to take this type of argument to TSC because we're just spinning wheels.</p>
",3080
"===",5525,"2015-02-11 04:18:08.186644+00","<p>
It's not a question of perspective.  There are lots of implementations of consent in Canada and they're all very simple structures.  And yes, that includes PharmaNet.  We're not trying to design what consent *should* be or what best practice is.  We're designing what's currently in broad use.  What *should* be (or what a particular group's opinion is of what should be.) can be handled through context-specific profiles.  The base Consent resource/profile needs to follow the 80% rule.  Derived profiles that bind themselves to specific contexts (e.g. U.S. meaningful use, best practice according to whoever, etc.) can make things as complicated as they wish.  But that complication is done using extensions.</p>

<p>
The SDC profile for Questionnaire is here: <a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/questionnaire-sdc-structureddatacaptureform.html."">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/questionnaire-sdc-structureddatacaptureform.html.</a>  Over half of the elements on it are extensions.</p>

<p>
This isn't a TSC question.  It's an FMG/FGB question.  FGB sets the guiding principles for how FHIR resources and profiles need to be structured.  FMG manages that process and ensures everyone complies.  TSC isn't going to override fundamental precepts of how FHIR works.</p>

<p>
It's perfectly fine to have a Profile that contains the exact same structures you have in the current profile - but that needs to be a profile with a base of Consent and much of the content needs to be handled through extensions.  The base Consent structure (whether it's a profile or a resource) needs to adhere to the 80% rule.</p>

Might I suggest that the ConsentDirective project include a ""Basic-ConsentDirective"" that supports blanket consents without exceptions. Essentially the common HIE policies from BPPC. These would be scoped to sharing beyond the original organization and purpose for which the health information was created. This form of a Consent Directive would need only (identifier, issued, applies, subject, authority, domain, type=consent, subtype=&lt;some vocabulary&gt;, and possibly friendly and legal). This Basic Consent Directive would support the following HIE subtypes:</p>

<p>
1) Opt-In -- Agree to publish ""All"" healthcare information. Agree to Use and Disclosure to ""any"" authorized individual of a ""Treatment"" or ""Payment"" organization ""For the Purpose"" of ""Treatment"" or ""Payment"". No Redisclosure allowed without further authorization. This agreement does not authorize other accesses.</p>

Agree to Use and Disclosure to ""any"" authorized individual of a Treatment organization for specifically ""Emergency Treatment"" PurpoeOfUse, and Payment of those treatment. This agreement does not authorize other accesses.</p>

<p>
3) Opt-In summary access only -- Agree to publish ""All"" healthcare information.

From email to CBCC:</p>

<p>
I had an action item from last call to point to the documentation that explains the difference between the different types of profiles.  Specifically, the difference between ""good practice"" profiles and ""key"" profiles.  That documentation is here:</p>

<p>
<a href=""http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Profile_and_IG_Balloting"">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Profile_and_IG_Balloting</a></p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
You'll note that that documentation doesn't discuss whether the 80% rules apply when dealing with ""key"" profiles - that wasn't one of the considerations when we wrote up the document.  However, in subsequent discussion within the FMG, there is consensus that for ""key"" profiles, the same rules apply as for creating resources.  So elements should reflect the 80%, vocabulary bindings and other constraints should be permissive of the full possible range of implementations through-out the world in a wide variety of contexts, no elements should be marked as ""must support"", etc.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
These rules do not apply to ""best practice"" profiles which are assertions by a WG as to how systems *should* behave, most likely in a more narrow context.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
I would support the proposal from John to proceed to ballot with profiles that reflect both types of behavior:</p>

<p>
 - a ""key"" profile that reflects the lowest common denominator of what's done around patient consent right now and adheres to the rules for resource authorship</p>

<p>
- a ""good practice"" profile which complies with the ""key"" profile, but asserts what the CBCC work group believes systems should be striving towards.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Compliance with FHIR around consent would only require adherence to the ""key"" profile, but implementers could choose to comply with the more stringent profile, and regulatory bodies could choose to enforce the more stringent profile if they wished.</p>

Most implementers should be interacting with the object model.  And there's no issue with the object model having both - and the object model can enforce the invariant by changing the boolean to true if the deceased date is set and by throwing an exception if you try to make the boolean false.  If the object model isn't currently doing this, I think it should.  However, the wire format shouldn't allow transmission of data that could be inconsistent and I don't see enforcing that restriction as necessarily adding any complexity to implementers, given that most will simply interact with the object model exposed by the reference implementations.</p>

A condition covers both point-in-time diagnosis as well as assertions (and management) of longer-term conditions.  The notion of a problem list is dealt with through the combination of this resource as well as the List resource.  The identifier would not change over the lifetime of the condition.  You could update severity (and even type of condition) over time.  And you could go look at the history of the resource instance to see how it has evolved over time.  You can look at the onset date and the abatement date to look when the condition was present, even if the current date is now years later.  Given this, it's not clear that another resource is needed.</p>

Hi Lloyd.</p>

<p>
Your suggestion sounds appealing, but unfortunately does not work.  This is because there is no way to uniquly identify history elements within a single concern, and it assumes that a single identifier is always known in advance, and it isn't always.</p>

<p>
For example, consider the following scenario.</p>

<p>
System A = problem repostory </p>

<p>
System B = client 1 - system creates notes, and sends problems to the problem repository.</p>

<p>
System C = client 2 - edits the problem list in the problem repository.</p>

<p>
time 1) System A has no problems</p>

<p>
Time 2) System B creates a note and send problems - E.g. Patient has Diabetes (controlled)</p>

<p>
Time 3) System C sees that the probelm Diabetes exists so gets a problem from A and edits/updates. E.g. Patients Diabetes is (uncontrolled).  It does not create a new problem because one exists.</p>

<p>
Time 4) System B realizes that note was generated on wrong patient, and the observation it sent was invalid.  Sends System A - Diabetes = Error.</p>

<p>
How should System A resolve?   Should Diabetes be marked erroneous?   Answer,  No.  In this case there is another observation that is newer, but the system B has no way of identifying that the observation to remove is the instance at timepoint 2.  </p>

<p>
If Note that if system B had NOT sent and event, however the answer is yes. </p>

<p>
Acutally, you can't even use timestamps for this because its not safe - System B and C could send at exactly the send events at exactly the same time.   Also, System A can't rely on even the distinction between System B or C to keep strait since the same system may send incorrect messages and correct messages at different points in time.</p>

<p>
BTW, this is a real example, and it created a mess  System A did have an event history but it was basically impossible to sort out. because System B had no way to see it, or clarify which events it had sent.  </p>

<p>
There is another problem in that if System B sends an problem without checking to see if that problem exists on System A first, then to merge this problem System A needs to change the instance ids on events from System B.    So merging problems becomes a nightmare and cleaning up the problem list becomes near impossible.</p>

Hi Larry,</p>

<p>
There's no issue around detection of collisions.  Every version has an etag and a timestamp, so system B will be aware that the diabetes record has been updated since they last recorded it.  They would be forced to re-query and would have to then make the decision about whether their notion that the diabetes was in fact non-existent for that patient was correct - likely by picking up the phone.  Only after they had confirmed the correct course of action would they update the system B record.  The resolution of the ETag mechanism is *required* to detect collisions, no matter how close the updates are made.</p>
",105
"===",5546,"2015-01-24 00:36:57.687352+00","<p>
Presumably where you say ""System B"" you mean System A - the repository.  </p>

<p>
If I understand correctly, then in this case then basically what I've been calling the ""event id"" is basically the condition identifier + etag+timestamp (?) and what I've been calling the ""concern id"" is just the condition identifier.</p>

<p>
OK.  Helpful, but then more questions.  I'm still struggling to see how I could make this work using your etag solution.</p>

<p>
1) how does one represent that a condition was seen on 3 different encounters and see what dates those visits occured?  </p>

<p>
2) how does one correctly merge conditions and do cleanup work?  E.g. system B records ""Rash"", and System C records ""Uticaria"", and ""System D"" records ""Skin Lesion"", and these all get sent under different ID's, then somebody looks at all these and decides they are all the same, so they all get merged into ""Rash"".  How do system C and D know that the records they sent are now related under a different id's history?  E.g. When the path result comes back and now shows that the ""rash"" is now a skin cancer, how does System C know that this is related to the thing it called (and still calls) Uticaria?  Can the etag indicate that a resource is now replaced by?   </p>

<p>
3) Many systems just send information.  These systems can't be made to just 're-query' the problem list.  Eg.  A NLP parse of a document can find problems and send to a problem list, but it doesn't query the problem list.  A pick of a structured problem in the note might have the condition id to send for matching, but that can't be guaranteed.  A prior event ID can be identified, but the condition id might not even be known when it sends.  These ID's still need to be resolved on the repostitory side (e.g. add if not already there).   Theres absolutely no way a system like this can ""pick up the phone"" to resolve something based on an event like the fact that the entire ""document was made erroneous"".  It could problably identify the prior event id's but system B may not even have a condition ID yet.</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
 </p>
",3260
"===",5546,"2015-01-25 06:03:32.462598+00","<p>
Yes.</p>

<p>
Each version of the resource has an identifier and a timestamp.  The current version has an etag that changes each time the resource is updated (it could be the version id, but need not be).</p>

<p>
Tracking that a condition was seen (or any other record was seen) is done using SecurityEvent.  While it's possible for that information to be queried, I wasn't aware that it was common practice (except for audit, legal and other purposes) for clinicians to examine who looked at what record when.  The dates of the encounters would be captured in their specific encounter records.</p>

<p>
Linking ""replaced"" records to the ""replacing"" record isn't part of core in FHIR, but could be done using extensions.  (Not a lot of systems have this level of sophistication/coordination.)  I'd be comfortable with a change request to define a common extension for this purpose though.</p>

<p>
Sending new data to a problem list (e.g. from an NLP parse) would not attempt to update existing records, it would just add new records to the list.  A human would then currate the list and have to determine what of the newly added data should be combined with existing entries, what should be retained and what should be removed.  I guess in theory, an automated algorithm could attempt it, though it would have to be pretty impressive.  In any case, you could look at Provenance to see exactly what changes had been made during the reconciliation process.</p>

Patient Care 1/29/15 -- end up with two flavors of issues.  Problem lists have a mix of conditions -- added at different points of time,or it is blank because no one is using the problem list.  An observation is always true, but the problem list is not always true.  Is a problem list curated?  The list resource is used - but the list can convey with is changing on the list.  A condition can be asserted and then removed as well as a status.  1.

Condition can be used to capture point-in-time snapshots (diagnosis, symptom) as well as curated objects (problems).  FHIR has List resources.  In principle, there can be hundreds of them, maintained by anyone.  In practice, organizations will figure out what lists will exist, whether they'll be shared or practitioner-specific and what the curation mechanisms will be.  It's entirely possible for problem lists to include multiple occurrences of a problem as well as certain problems that have resolved (but are still of interest).</p>

I don't agree that it makes sense on compose. If you're going to process compose, you have to know the properties of the code systems you are composing on, so it's silly - in fact, dangerous - to repeat it in the compse (where it might disagree with the code system definition)</p>

<p>
I think it's in the define for safety reasons; in fact, I know that few systems track this, and I also know that operationally, this is a source of confusion, and unsafe clinical practice. So I added it originall outside the 80% rule (we have a few other elements like this)</p>

<p>
It's not so obvious to me whether it should go in the expansion or not. If you're using expansion for validation, then it matters, but I don't think it matters for other uses (?not sure. there's a variety). But an expansion could cross code systems, so it would have to be either on every contained code, or it would have to be in a manifest that described the code systems.

Expanding a little on this part: do include/exclude also operate on the imported value set(s), or only on code system?</p>

If include/exclude are meant to also operate on imported value sets then it is kind of impossible enforce include/exclude on the expanded version of the imported value set. The imported value set could again be an intensional value set that imports other value sets etc. So what you could do is</p>

I thought we'd done value set reference for pointers to real value sets, but I guess not.  So you'd have to try to resolve the URI.  If it gives you a value set, you can expand.  If it gives you HTML or something else, then you can't.  Agree this should be clarified.  And may make sense to change to a choice of URI vs. Reference(ValueSet) to avoid the need to try to resolve when determining whether you can expand.</p>

Is the attachment really necessary? Meaning should this be only about WADO retrieval? If we are sticking with just the wado URL, then ImagingStudy and ImageObjectSelection should use the same element name (imagingStudy uses url, ImageObjectSelection uses retrieveUrl)</p>

If attachment is needed, then we should consider using the attachment datatype. In that case we would replace both url and attachment with just the attachment.</p>

How do we reconcile or document that <em>DocumentReference.reference.identifier </em>may not match the <em>DocumentReference.reference.resource.identifier</em> (for example, if the <em>DocumentReference.reference.identifier </em>is taken from XDS metadata with a value of ""134467653^^^1.2.3.4.5.42.1^urn:ihe:iti:xds:2013:order"", then it is unlikely that the corresponding Order resource will use ""urn:ihe:iti:xds:2013:order"" as the system).

There are challenges with having ""title"" on List.  It gets kind of wonky when Document.section has title and Document.section points to List which also has a title.  We don't want to remove Document.section.title because it's possible for the document title to be specific to where the list appears in the document and also for documents to have rules about what the title must be.  (And you don't want to have to revise the title of the List instance to comply with a document profile.)</p>

We've discussed this at length before. Firstly, there's no right answer for whether you want a shallow or a deep comparison on equals. Secondly, overriding equals can have some deeply unexpected answers in hash maps, etc. So every time, we agree not to override equals, and I think it's the right decision. but we did decidel, and I see haven't done this - to generate equivalent methods for both deep and shallow, so that they are there for if you want them </p>

This has been an ongoing discussion on the HAPI v2 library community as well for many years (seriously, it's been 12+ years!).</p>

<p>
I'm of the opinion that supporting equals/hashCode on the HL7 domain objects (either for v2 or for FHIR) is a bad idea, since it's ambiguous what should be compared. Do you compare just the object itself, or other nested referenced objects? How do you treat values that are logically equivalent even if they aren't identical? etc etc etc..</p>

Having explicit deepEquals and shallowEquals methods is helpful as long as the semantics are clearly documented, but the only reason to need equals/hashCode is to use these methods as a key in a map. I just don't think that this makes sense.</p>

Hi Grahame - </p>

<p>
Please see the meeting notes from the <a href=""http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=January_2015_WGM_San_Antonio:_Jan_18_to_Jan_23#Patient_Care_Tuesday_Q1"">Reconciliation Discussion at the San Antonio Workgroup meeting.</a> (Tuesday Q1). The recommendation from Lloyd was to use Provenance Resource. If this is not the way to go, should we ask if we can add to the agenda to discuss this at the Patient Care FHIR call this thursday? IHE PCC Volume one finalization is in two weeks. We would need direction from the FHIR Team about the right way to communicate that list or collection of things have been reconciled using FHIR Resouces. You will find the <a href=""ftp://ftp.ihe.net/Patient_Care_Coordination/yr11_2015-2016/Technical%20Committee/RECON_on_FHIR/IHE_Suppl_Template_RECON_on_FHIR_02082015.doc"">IHE PCC draft profile here</a>. </p>

<p>

<p>
Thanks, Emma </p>

Reconciliation is the process of taking one or more lists of information (or other list-like resources such as CarePlan or FamilyHistory) and either updating a master list or generating a new list.  Provenance allows you to identify what sources of information were used in deriving the new list/resource version and who was responsible for doing the curation.  So provenance is correct.</p>

<p>
To meet Emma's use-case, we need support for reverse include which, though we've talked about it multiple times, is apparently still not there.</p>

PC WG 2/12/15 -- for reconciliation purposes, can point the ""list"" to other resources.  For example who are the participants in the care plan?  Can point to the care plan, but is that granular enough?  Can do a profile on provenance.reason to faciliatate reconciliation.  Note that ""include reverse"" (5679).  The reason code indicates that a reconciliation has occurred.   If it were not a reconciliation such as a medication list, what would provenance.reason -- could be used for correction, business event...</p>

Per FMG: </p>

<p>
""ReverseInclude"" will enable the ability to retrieve the provenance associated with a resource. Lloyd suggests the following syntax: </p>

<p>
_revinclude=[Resource path that points to this resource]</p>

<p>
E.g. Patient?_revinclude=Provenance.target</p>

<p>
<a href=""http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=5679&amp;start=0"">See tracker 5679 </a></p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
Provenance Resource is used to stipulate why a resource was changed - could be a correction, business reason for a change, reconciliation etc(i.e.why another version of a resource came into being). In the case of reconciliation, provenance will be used to say that reconciliation occurred.</p>

<p>
For the situation where care team members or goals or activities are being reconciled, provenance should point to care plan resource and use the reason element in provenance to stipulate what has been reconciled. </p>

The ""M"" doesn't say mandatory, it says ""modifier"".  I.e. The value conveyed can modify the meaning of the element.  That doesn't mean that the use will always be known, so I don't think we can make it 1..1.</p>

This comes down to an 80% question.  Do most implementers of a particular resource support multiple identifiers?  If so, it should repeat.  If not, it shouldn't and additional identifiers should be conveyed using extensions where they're needed.  However, would be good to have this as official guidance and get WGs to review.</p>

The point about data types is relevant for integration engine systems.  Often we have people with a variable amount of training working on doing message translations.  Having data type checking on as many fields as possible helps prevent garbage data.</p>

<p>
Two days ago I saw a very senior engineer doing something that resulted in data similar to ""XYZ.1.2.3"" going into an OID field (it was an HL7v2 vs v3 mixup).  Only the data type validating as an OID prevented them from going farther and having to spend time clearing up the issue when a system down the chain gets an error.</p>

<p>
I feel like it's better to spend the time ahead with people that really understand something building a spec well- so that the line engineers that use the result of this work can do their jobs with a lesser understanding of the spec.  Having the data types as restrictive as is practicable is an important part of that.  ""Oh, I can't put XYZ.1.2.3 in this field?  Ok.""</p>

I don't think that we can make an 80% decision across the entire spec.  It needs to be done on a resource by resource basis.  Having multiple identifiers on Observation is indeed pretty common.  Having multiple identifiers on a MessageHeader is pretty much unheard of.  It needs to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis around what systems actually do.</p>

Variance in pattern is allowed if there are variations in how this information is typically captured for a given type of record.  Do you feel that the way the information is being represented in FHIR diverges from how systems would typically capture it?</p>

In terms of MedicationPrescription and MedicationStatement, MedicationStatement can be written by by clinicians too, often as summaries of current medications.  I.e. you can't assume that medication statements are patient-entered or reported.</p>

For Observation, Observation.performer can be Pracitioner, Organization, Patient or RelatedPerson.  (Make sure you're looking at the continuous integration site before reporting non-technical issues as the resources have continued to evolve since DSTU 1)</p>

<p><br />
Of the resources that do support knowing ""who"", they do so differently.  In some cases, it is a different attribute name.  In some cases, it is a different data type (boolean or link to a resource).  In some cases, it is a different spin on patient-reported data by denoting who is taking responsibility (regardless of who enters or reports it).</p>

There's no expectation of consistency as a general rule.  Detailed information about exactly who was involved in a record change (data enterer, decision maker, responsible person, device used, information source, etc.) is generally not captured directly on all resource.  What gets exposed and how it gets exposed varies depending on what systems capture and higlight now.  Similarly, the names can vary.based on context.  All that said, we're asking work groups to look at consistency of naming as part of the next release and ensure that variations in naming and approach are indeed being driven by distinct business conventions (not merely because those portions of the specifications may have been authored by different people.)</p>

<p>
The Provenance resource provides a mechanism of capturing *all* of these data elements for all resources in a consistent way in those situations where someone wants to go look to understand the full context of a particular version of a record.</p>

<p>
If you think that the notion of capturing any of these aspects (author, recorder, reporter, etc.) falls within the 80% (almost all existing systems do it for a given resource type), then please raise specific change requests noting any evidence you have that most existing systems do this for that resource type.  Where most systems *don't* do it, you could request a common extension be defined or you could fall back on provenance.</p>

There were really 2 use cases that this operation intended to cover:<br />

- getting all the resources for an author<br /><br />
The first is not strictly the same as the patient/$everything or the patient compartment, because the subject may not be a patient. The second is not so obvious, since if it really mattered we could define a compartment for it, but no one has ever come and said we should.

Strongly disagree with this.  An encounter represents an event that is ""happening"".  Mixing ""intent"" and ""event"" within the same resource is something we try to avoid unless it matches with business practice.  I'm not aware of any business practice where ""proposed"" encounters would appear side-by-side with ""actual"" encounters in the same user interface/persistence layer/etc.</p>

Adding ""proposed"" as a status for appointment would be more consistent with how this issue is being handled in other spaces.</p>

But no-one requests ""encounters"".  They propose, plan or order procedures or diagnostic tests and plan, propose or make referrals or appointments.  Encounters come about as a result of one of those things.  We would only add a new resource if there was a type of request that was used in practice that was distinct from all of those things.  (The fact there's potentially a many-to-many relationship between types of requests and types or resulting activities is just the reality of how healthcare works.)</p>

But those are abstract models and that's not what FHIR is targeted towards.  When looking at real data, QDM and QRDA would need to look at ReferralRequest and Appointment and ProcedureRequest and DiagnosticOrder to find whether an encounter had been ""requested"" anyhow.  Adding an additional EncounterRequest resource wouldn't make things better - it would make them worse.  And odds are good that the EncounterRequest resource would never be populated by real systems.  While there is overlap between the use of ReferralRequest, Appointment, ProcedureRequest and DiagnosticOrder, there are lots of clear spaces where only one of those is appropriate and even where there is overlap, there is (or will soon be) guidance about which one(s) should be used in a given circumstance.  It's not clear what guidance could be given for this new resource.</p>

I did some digging with the help of Chris Moesel. In current US quality measures, Encounter, Order appears only twice. In CMS169, the encounter order is for Outpatient Psychotherapy and so it could be captured as a ReferralRequest. In CMS 111, the time of the Encounter, Order is used as the time of the hospital admit <strong>decision</strong> in the ER (as distinct from the<strong> actual </strong>admit time). I think that corresponds to time recorded in the statusHistory of the hospitalization, where Encounter.status=”planned”, so long as the ER visit and hospitalization aren't the same Encounter (they shouldn't be). So I think we are good without further extensions to FHIR to capture QDM in these two existing cases. A recommended followup visit could be captured by a ""pending"" Appointment. We may want to document that usage. Overall, I think we have this one covered, and the tracker can be closed.</p>

I don't understand how you could withhold the mediation details and not withhold the medication administration.

The only case I can think of is where a device is emitting observations and it has no knowledge of the subject of the observations. Typically, some intermediary injeccts that knowledge into the data flow. But it's not clear to me whether the device -&gt; intermediary flow is in scope for the Observation resource.

That's definitely in scope.  As a rule, we're extremely cautious about making things 1..1.  If there's any possibility of a system not having the element and still doing something useful, we make minOccurs=0.  Resources don't ever enforce ""good practice"".  That said, it's reasonable to expect usage notes on elements you would expect to be 1..1 that explain why they're not.</p>

To me, this is evidence of a bigger problem - the scope of procedure is not really well characterised. The content model is not suitable for any particular scope either.

A Procedure instance represents something that has happened.  A ProcedureRequest represents something that is desired to happen.  This information is typically captured in different places within systems and user interfaces.  As well, the data elements necessary to capture an order or proposal for a procedure differ from those that are used to capture what actually happened.  Procedure follows the same pattern used in observations (DiagnosticRequest vs. DiagnosticReport/Observation), pharmacy (MedicationPrescription vs. MedicationDispense/MedicationAdministration), etc.  The status of ""proposed"" doesn't mean that you're proposing an order, it means that the intention of a procedure being done is at the ""proposal"" stage rather than being a fully authorized ""active"" order.</p>

I'm sorry, I must not be explaining the issue clearly. The ProcedureRequest (or ProcedureOrder) is defined as ""A request for a procedure to be performed."" The status is defined as ""the status of the order"". Therefore, ProcedureRequest.status = ""proposed"" that means the <em>order</em> is proposed, not the procedure. When the procedure order is ""planned"" is not a planned procedure, but rather that the <em>order</em> is planned. This is not what we want.</p>

<p>
A suitable set of statuses for the <em>order</em> (i.e. the ProcedureRequest) is proposed (e.g. so it can undergo review) | sent | received | accepted | rejected, while a suitable set of statuses for Procedure is planned | in-progress | completed | suspended | aborted. </p>

&gt;&gt;I don't see why you say that doesn't make sense&lt;&lt;   I <u>am</u> saying you should be able to propose a procedure. However Lloyd has pointed out that the way to do that in FHIR is to propose a ProcedureOrder (currently named ProcedureRequest), rather than to propose the procedure directly. I'm fine with that. Much of the discussion above is about status values. My view is that the ProcedureOrder has some life cycle, e.g.: proposed, sent (aka requested), received, accepted (approved), revised, resubmitted, rejected, etc...  Some time after approval or the order, the Procedure is created, which should also have a life cycle (independent of the order lifecycle), e.g. approved, planned, in-progress, completed, aborted, suspended, etc...   Lloyd has taken the position that status of the Procedure should be incorporated into the status of the ProcedureOrder, and I object to that, based on the fact that the order and the resulting procedure (if any) have separate lifecycles. Furthermore, a Procedure can exist without a ProcedureOrder, so the status of the procedure can't be stored in the ProcedureOrder. Lastly, as you correctly point out, Grahame, without a status, the current Procedure resource seems more like a ""ProcedureStatement"". </p>
",3163
"===",5707,"2015-02-18 17:09:21.758537+00","<p>
You don't ""propose"" a ProcedureOrder.  You use the ProcedureRequest resource to represent the proposal for a procedure (or the plan for a procedure or the order for a procedure).  Think of all of them as ""ProcedureIntent"". </p>

<p>
The status of the Procedure is not incorporated into the ProcedureOrder.  The Procedure resource does act more as a ProcedureStatement - because that's what most EHRs track.  I'd be open to renaming it.</p>

<p>
Procedure would never have a status of approved, planned, etc.  It could be ""in-progress"", ""completed"" or ""aborted"", but as a statement, it generally is only relevant to be ""completed"".</p>

Lloyd, I don't follow your logic. At 2015-02-17 20:54:26 you did seem to say ""proposed"" and ""planned"" are valid status values for ProcedureRequest (what I've been interchangeably been calling ProcedureOrder). But you also seem to say that the status of the ProcedureRequest is not the status of the ProcedureRequest. That's nonsensical.</p>

PS - Could you answer me the questions I posed on 2015-02-18 09:00:20? </p>

If the ProcedureRequest.status says ""proposed"" that means that the ProcedureRequest currently represents a proposal for the procedure to occur.  If it says ""active"", that means the ProcedureRequest currently represents an active order for the procedure to occur.  I don't understand what the confusion is.</p>

<p>
A Procedure ""resource"" would never have a status of ""planned"" because Procedure represents a statement about a procedure that has happened (in theory it could represent a statement about a procedure that's occurring, but it's not clear whether there's a use-case for that or not).  If you want to talk about planned procedures, you use the ProcedureRequest resource - just as when you want to talk about planned drug administrations you use MedicationPrescription, not MedicationAdministration.</p>

In my opinion, Lloyd's proposed definitions make no sense. I strongly agree with Grahame. There is no case is FHIR where X.status = Y means anything other than ""the status of X is Y"". It is that simple. As I said previously, the request for a procedure has a certain life cycle captured in its status: the request may be proposed, sent (aka requested), received, accepted (approved), revised, resubmitted, rejected, etc. This only concerns the procedure request and its disposition. Subsequently, a procedure (for the purposes of discussion, the activity flavor, not the ProcedureStatement flavor) may be created. The procedure has an independent life cycle, whose status may be (for example), booked, planned, in-progress, completed, aborted, suspended, etc. Lloyd, is there something you don't agree with in my description? I have thus far failed to grasp your objections, or even understand what position you are trying to advocate. </p>

<p>
PS - you still haven't answered my questions.</p>
",3163
"===",5707,"2015-02-19 07:23:32.788495+00","<p>
I agree that the ""proposed"" and ""planned"" statuses behave a bit differently than the others.  We're mixing moods and statuses here, so that may be throwing you off a bit.  The work groups discussed whether to handle these using a separate attribute or to combine them into status.  The decision was to do the latter because it allowed for more flexible workflow.  ""proposed"" and ""planned"" are being added to *all* of the order-ish classes - MedicationProcedure, DiagnosticOrder, ReferralRequest, VisionPrescription and likely Appointment.  So it's not true that ""There is no case in FHIR"".  FHIR statuses don't always behave the same way as v3 statuses.</p>

<p>
ProcedureStatement (which I think more accurately reflects what the resource we have is for) will not have a status of booked, planned, in-progress, etc.  It may be that Procedure itself will, though I'm not sure many (if any) systems capture it with that level of granularity.  I think most of the statuses you've attributed to Procedure will likely end up getting captured only on Encounter rather than Procedure itself.</p>

<p>
It's probably best to look at this by examining the Medication resources.  There's MedicationPrescription which can be (or at least will soon be able to be) ""proposed"", ""planned"", ""active"", etc.  Then there's MedicationStatement which can be in-progress or completed and MedicationAdministration which can be in-progress, completed, on-hold or stopped.  There's no notion of ""proposed"" for any of the ""event"" resources.  And for Procedure, the notion of ""on-hold"" probably wouldn't apply either.  (While you can turn off an IV for a while and then turn it back on, procedures typically either complete or get aborted.)</p>

<p>
In terms of your questions</p>

<p>
(1) Given your defintion of ""proposed"" and ""planned"", would you also define ""in-progress"" as ""The procedure is in progress"" and ""completed"" as ""The procedure has been completed""?</p>

<p>
I don't think ""in-progress"" makes sense as a Procedure code.  It was copied from Observation where there's value in saying that the lab has started the steps.  I don't think that's typically communicated in the case of procedures.  But if I were to define it, I would say ""The requested procedure or set of procedures has been initiated"".  And for completed, I'd say ""The requested procedure or set of procedures has finished"".</p>

<p>
(2) In what way does ""planned"" involve obtaining formal authorization for the procedure? </p>

<p>
It doesn't.  Planned is the step before formal authorization.  It just means that there's a commitment/intention to procede.</p>

<p>
(3) What happens to the status value when the formal authorization for the procedure is obtained? </p>

<p>
It changes to Requested (if done using the same instance), though in some workflows, a separate resource instance will be created to represent the ""order"".</p>

<p>
(4) After formal authorization is obtained, and subsequently resources are allocated to perform the procedure, but before procedure has been performed, what should be the status of the ProcedureRequest?</p>

<p>
Could be ""Requested"", ""Received"" or ""Accepted"", though again I'm not sure that those latter two make sense in the Procedure space - copy and paste from Observation again.</p>

<p>
(5) When the procedure itself is completed, which resource(s) should be updated to reflect this fact?</p>

<p>
Whenever you have an order and that order is fulfilled, both the fulfilling resource (Procedure, MedicationDispense, Observation, whatever) and the order (ProcedureRequest/ReferralRequest, MedicationPrescription, DiagnosticOrder, etc.) generally reflect the ""completed"" state, though it's possible that it may take multiple fulfilling resources to actually bring the full order to completion.  As well, in some cases (e.g. MedicationPrescription in a community setting), there may not be a closed feedback loop, so the order resource might be updated based on the presumed completion based on elapsed time rather than explicit confirmation that all desired action has occurred.</p>

Thanks for addressing the questions. Please let me explain why I disagree with your proposed defintions. You say planned means ""The procedure has been agreed to in principle but no formal authorization has yet been initiated"".  According to the dictionary, plan means ""to create or design a scheme of action"" so planned means ""the scheme of action has been created"". Whether planning comes before, during, or after formal authorization depends on local workflows. If Joe needs a knee replacement, first the physician proposes it, then Hank's insurance company pre-approves it, then only then does the planning (making the appointment, picking location, allocating resources) commences. So here the pattern is propose, approve, plan, execute.</p>

<p>
If Joe is paying out of pocket, the workflow would be physician approval, planning, then execution. As you can see, in both of these use cases, approval does not follow planning, it precedes it.</p>

<p>
Nor do I agree with your definition of ""proposed"" as ""the procedure has been suggested but no commitment has yet been made""  The flaw in this definition is that commitment is made only when the procedure is approved. So your definition actually applies to any pre-approval status. ""Requested"" also is a state where the procedure has been suggested, but no commitment has been made. Ergo, it satisfies your definition of ""proposed"". Two statuses cannot have the same definition.  </p>

<p>
To close on this, I agree that ProcedureRequest itself represents the intent for the procedure to occur. The status tells us how far this intent has moved towards realization. ""Proposed"" is the first proffering of this intent. ""Requested"" means the request has been transmitted to the approval authority. ""Approved"" means that the request has been approved. ""Planned"" means the request is moving toward concrete realization. QED.</p>

"===",5707,"2015-02-19 17:34:44.131531+00","<p>
From our perspective, the semantics of ""planned"" and ""proposed"" are (and must be) narrower than general use.  The requirements in terms of state machine are ""proposed"" (whether as a recommendation from a consult or from a decision support engine) to ""planned"" - captured in a care plan but no formal order yet created to ""requested"" - formal order created that authorizes action to proceed.  Something being in a care plan doesn't necessarily allow resources to flow, etc.  If you don't like those terms, we can evaluate others, but all of the involved work groups find the chosen terms fairly intuitive.</p>

<p>
Not all of those stages will necessarily happen.  You can skip the first two.  You can go directly from ""proposed"" to ""requested"".</p>

<p>
The ""planning"" process as you use the word is actually happening through-out the various statuses.  Planning is happening from the moment a proposal is considered through to the point the action is complete.  I can't think of a business trigger that would differentiate between ""accepted"" and ""planned"" as you've defined it.</p>

I think what we have here is a failure to communicate. Why don't we use a sequence diagram to help us converge?  I attached my view of the sequence of events as a png file.

OK, now we are much closer to convergence. I uploaded another picture (RequestSequence-2.png) based on your input. There is still the problem of ""planned"" describing two states: one where the details of the request have been filled in, and the other where the task entailed by the request is in the ""planned"" state. If only could find a way to disambiguate this by finding distinct names for those two states, we could call this issue closed. </p>

"===",5707,"2015-02-22 00:45:29.190883+00","<p>
I've updated the diagram.  I don't think there is any status change in the order when the filler plans what they're going to do - that's done solely on the filler side - the filler isn't allowed to update the order resource, though they may well create their own.  There is however a ""planned"" state where the requester agrees that ""yes, eggs ought to be bought"" but hasn't yet decided when to get them or who is going to get them or even just gotten around to the point where they want to write up the grocery list.</p>

Great, this is definitely progress. We agree on the sequence, and we agree on not reflecting the detailed task status in the request status. Here are the remaining issues:</p>

<p>
(1) Task statuses can include ""planned"", and that is what I originally found confusing. It still is. I propose we call the state where the details of the request have been created ""formulated"" instead of ""planned"".</p>

<p>
(2) ""Refused"" and ""rejected"" are too easy to mix up. That's why I think we should use ""proposal-refused"" and ""request-rejected"".  </p>

<p>
(3) ""Accepted"" could refer to acceptance of the proposal or acceptance of the request. Since we are talking about the latter, ""request-accepted"" is much more clear. </p>

<p>
(3) Also, ""fulfilled"" is probably a better word than ""completed"" with respect to a request. (This is minor)</p>

1. Something like ""Encounter"" can be ""planned"", but what that really means is that the event has started from an administrative perspective, but not yet from a functional perspective.  I.e. You've started doing pre-admit labs, the room/equipment have been prepped, etc.  But the patient hasn't showed up for the actual encounter yet.  I don't think you'll be able to sell PA on ""formulated"", but may be able to get them to improve the definition for the code</p>

<p>
2. Typo on my part - both the same status of ""Refused"".  No differentiation of whether it was rejected as a proposal or an order.  This was discussed with the WGs and they decided they didn't need it.</p>

<p>
3. Ditto</p>

<p>
4. But that's not the word that's used in business.  Remember, we're not creating an abstract model here, we're using typical business terms.  We're not going to end up with a consistent set of status words used the same across all resources.  The most we'll accomplish is reducing some of the unnecessary diversity we have now.</p>

Other clinical resources have similar status codes (AllergyIntolerance). It's not a reuqirement of FHIR methodology that names be consistent across resources, but that they be consistent with the domain language of people who deal with this.

The notions of things like ""accepted"" or ""completed"" don't apply here.  To a certain extent, the transition from provisional to working to confirmed or refuted is equivalent to the transition from pending to active to aborted or completed.  We can confirm with the work group whether they prefer this name or some other, but no reason to change if they don't want to.</p>

Grahame, you are correct that AllergyIntolerance is the other exception to the typical definition of status. It is like a condition in that respect.

I disagree.  ""is_a"" is clear.  ""descendant of"" could be based on hierarchy of definition and might include composition relationships, which would be wrong.  I.e. you wouldn't want a ""descendant of"" relationship between street number and address line.  Changing the name doesn't make any difference in terms of what coding systems you could support.</p>

Why wouldn't you want composition relationships? </p>
",150
"===",5785,"2015-03-10 22:04:56.609816+00","<p>
Because composition and is_a are distinct things.  You can't use one code for both.  They have different logical properties.  You can do subsumption on is_a.  You can't do subsumption on a ""contains"".  For example, a street address number is not a kind of street address line and doesn't satisfy a requirement to send a street address line.</p>
",105
"===",5785,"2015-03-10 22:08:21.809217+00","<p>
The fact that they are separate things doesn't appear to mean that you can't use one code for both in the context of a filter. is there code systems that have both composition and subsumption where you want to differentiate between them? </p>

",150
"===",5785,"2015-03-11 01:00:13.830338+00","<p>
Sure.  SNOMED has ""part of"" relationships in addition to ""is a"" relationships.  MIF defined a set of standard relationship types: Specializes, ComponentOf, GroupedBy, LessThan, DefinitionallyQualifies, NonDefinitionallyQualifies</p>

<p>
Of those, Specializes, ComponentOf, GroupedBy and LessThan would be candidates for ""standard"" filter codes that could be used with code systems that employ those concepts but don't define specific named properties for those types of relationships.  (MIF also defines the inverses of the above, but not sure if there's a use-case for those here.)</p>

",105
"===",5785,"2015-03-11 02:39:47.199163+00","<p>
Actually, I don't think there is an absolute right or wrong between the choice of descendantOf and is-a in this context, but I think that Lloyd has some good arguments.  If descendantOf is used in a proper subsumption hierarchy, then I think its use is correct and unambiguous.  However, I can think of a different use of ""descendant"" which is also common and correct and isn't at all what we want here - that would be in the family tree.  In that context, my children and grandchildren are clearly my ""descendants"", but they certainly are not ""subtypes"" of me - they are obviously related, but not by is-a. </p>

<p>
So I think that using is-a probably is much clearer about the subsumption behavior that we desire.  But is-a also has a couple of issues of its own.  One is the particular question here, in that it doesn't seem to be obvious to many (most?) whether the ""self relationship"" is expected to be part of the logical use of is-a, or not.  The other issue is the potential confounding with the SNOMED CT use of ""Is a"" in its distributed subsumption hierarchy.  In SNOMED CT only some of the logical is-a relationships (the transitive closure) are actually instantiated (via ""Is a"") - and the ""self is-a"" relationships explicitly are not instantiated.  So, if you perform a hierarchical query based on the distributed set of SNOMED CT ""Is a"" relationships, the ""head code"" will not be included in the result set.</p>

<p>
Bottom line, I think that staying with the use of is-a probably makes sense.  But, if we do, we need to say more in its definition than simply ""The specified property of the code has an is-a relationship with the provided value"" (which is a circular definition, anyway).  We need to be clear that the intended meaning is in the logical sense (not in the SNOMED CT as distributed sense), and we need to be explicitly clear that the ""self is-a"" relationship is expected to hold.  And the downstream effect of that last point would be that if you want to ""intensionally"" define a value set based on is-a and you do not want the ""head code"" to be included in the expansion for some reason then you will need to explicitly exclude it in the value set definition (which shouldn't be much of a problem, as long as you know that you need to do it).</p>
",247
"===",5785,"2015-03-11 02:47:43.734598+00","<p>
we already have a value set that excludes the head code. So what's a better definition? </p>

The ""Using SNOMED CT with FHIR"" page (<a href=""http://hl7-fhir.github.io/snomedct.html"">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/snomedct.html</a>) does actually spell out all of the behavior that I mentioned quite clearly.  So maybe we should extract some of the ""generic"" parts of that explanation and include it in (or link it to) the is-a FilterOperator definition.</p>

The original intent was that you'd say whether you wanted inactive codes as a condition of expansion, because you know whether you want them or not. That doesn't work so well if you're persisting expansions, where the decision about including valid or invalid codes might be separated from whether you want to include them or not, but that's more an infrastructural issue with persisting expansions.

Having the discrete elements makes it possible for the narrative to be generated and allows discrete display of the descriptive content.  That's why we have discrete text fields in general.</p>

Why is it a problem for privacy assessments?  In most systems, family histories are cohesive documents.  You get it all or you get nothing.  Piece-meal control of the individual pieces is rare.  Querying family history and getting back everything but the mother is downright weird.  And the result is going to be that the mother is going to get created multiple times.  This is the same use-case as protecting individual patient addresses or next of kins or steps in a care plan.  It may exist in some very sophisticated environments, but adds a lot of complexity to workflow and processes required to currate records when different participants see different bits.</p>

<p>
The initial design (which you checked in May 2013) had 0..* relations and it's always been that way.</p>

<p>
Family History isn't recorded as a bunch of independent pieces.  The entire thing gets updated and has a single timestamp and a single author.  It's all considered as a coherent whole.  And you often have notes that apply to the whole history.  A history as narrative would also be the whole history, never the history of a single relative.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, even splitting the resource into individual relatives still wouldn't fix the problem, because the privacy issue isn't really the existence of the relative, it's the existence of a particular condition for a particular relative - and we're certainly not going to split that out.</p>

<p>
This requirement doesn't fall into the 80%.</p>

"===",5825,"2015-03-04 00:57:36.330031+00","<p>
It's true that the first commit had this structure, because I redesigned it before it's first commit. </p>

<p>
I don't believe that all your arguments are enough to justify a different approach for FamilyHistory to anything else. Others may wish to comment on the privacy part.</p>
",150
"===",5825,"2015-03-04 03:15:02.785917+00","<p>
We don't have a different approach for FamilyHistory than anything else.  The scope of FamilyHistory is ""What is the granularity with which this information is typically queried and maintained and to which Provenance would be applied within existing systems?""  And the answer to that question is ""the entire family history record"".  The percentage of times a practitioner would execute a query to retrieve the history of ""maternal grandmother"" or some other particular relative as opposed to the entire family history record is miniscule.  Similarly miniscule is the percentage of times a person would update an individual relative's record without at least thinking about the entire history.  You don't ask ""when was patient's familiy history for Aunt Sue last updated?"".  You ask ""When was the patient's family history last updated?""</p>

<p>
As well, it's often unsafe to update a relative without looking at the family history.  ""I just remembered that one of my mom's sisters had emphasema"".  ""Was that the one who died of breast caner or the other one?""  ""The other one"".  That conversation can only take place in a context where you can see who all the relatives are.</p>

<p>
There will always be security requirements that occur at a level of granularity below the resource.  We can't choose to split resources based on possible security requirements.  We split resources based on the granularity that's manipulated in common practice.  If security requirements have to be applied below that, then they incur that additional complexity.</p>

"===",5825,"2015-03-04 05:18:39.968057+00","<p>
Now is the time to think through Privacy controls, not just modeling. I see little negative to breaking family history up into component resources to hold each family members data. If you have rights to all of the data you can easily pull the full history and end up with all the data you have. But if a Privacy reason would have some information blocked, then managing this through resources is much easier and more natural for HTTP based access control systems. If we simply breakup the parts, we can use normal HTTP based access controls. If we insist on combining all of the family history into one resource, then we are accepting that we must use complex access controls that must understand the FHIR schema. This is indeed possible, but is unnecessary complexity. The FHIR Principles desire to drive for simple implementations that are Fast and Easy to use.</p>
",1078
"===",5825,"2015-03-04 06:28:53.717219+00","<p>
But privacy isn't at the level of the relative, it's at the level of the relative's condition.  So to truly support the requirement, you'd need to blow out the family history and instead have RelatedPerson be allowed to be the subject of Condition and all the complexity that goes with that.</p>

<p>
In talking with the genomics folks at the last WGM (who have the most sensitive family history data), the consensus is that individual controls on access to relative information within a family history record isn't necessary.  FamilyHistory about other relatives is generallly considered ""hearsay"" and not generally subject to special privacy protections at a granular level.</p>

<p>
I'm reluctant to force a change to granularity of the resource that will impact everyone who uses the resource and will make the resource harder to use to accomodate a privacy requirement that is largely theoretical and, to my knowledge, not generally implemented within existing systems.  That seems totally contrary to what the 80% design principle is supposed to guide us towards.</p>

<p>
I don't see this usecase as being any more common than the need to provide privacy protections on specific addresses, phone numbers or contacts and we're not considering splitting those out into separate resources.</p>

Entered in error would be weird.  You'd just correct the error - remove the relative, condition, etc.  The ""history"" of FamilyHistory would show what it looked like at a given point.  Family history is, by definition, always partially unknown.  How much the patient knows about a given relative and how accurate what they report is always somewhat suspect.  So absense of declaration of a condition in a relative doesn't mean they didn't have a condition, only that the reporter didn't know/suspect that they had a condition.  So the question is - do most systems flag whether information about a given relative is more ""unknown"" than usual?</p>

Entered in error - typically, you just correct things that are correctable. But if you enter on the wrong record, you've got nothing to correct it to, all you can do is delete it. But that's typically considered the wrong thing to do in a distributed clinical record. </p>

<p>
There's a difference between 'my mother lived till old age and was fine as far as I know'  and 'I don't know who my mother is at all, so I don't know her medical history'. (note: this is not an unusual entry in a family history)</p>

No, I just thought that by publishing a ""duration"" constraint on quantity, the implication was that resources/profiles were supposed to use it whenever a duration (number + time unit) is needed. It might be good to clarify when that duration is/is not to be used, or just do away with it.<br />

",105
"===",5855,"2015-03-08 17:07:26.562601+00","<p>
Yes, I think so. The status is all about workflow - eg if the goal is currently active or not whereas the outcome records in more detail what happens when the goal is closed. For example, the goal may have been to lose 10 kg in weight, but only 5 was lost - but still a success (albeit a partial one). Certainly the systems I've developed in the past have recorded outcome  - in response to clinician demand....</p>

"===",5855,"2015-03-08 19:15:53.681366+00","<p>
I would agree with David on this one, implementing software in other clinical areas we frequently find that the separation of the workflow status of the item and a coded reason it's in that status that's used more for reporting and display to the end user. Even though this is not typically used by the IT system it's still generally worth coding for use in reporting. It's also typically a lot more flexible site by site than the fixed set of status you want for interoperability of IT systems.</p>

<p>
The existing status code (and the fact it's a fixed set) provides a good basis for inter-operable systems. But for many of these statuses it's sensible to have an additional coded reason or sub-status.</p>

<p>
In my mind this is actually most visible with the canceled status. E.g. it's often useful to report on the difference between:</p>

<p>
- Canceled because the patient didn't buy in so was not achievable</p>

<p>
- Canceled because the patient has some other condition that makes achievement impractical</p>

<p>
- Canceled because the patient has a substantially more sever condition that is being focused on instead</p>

<p>
- Canceled because while the goal is not achieved, it's no longer relevant because the strategy for managing the condition has changed</p>

<p>
 </p>

<p>
While perhaps less clear cut, I agree with David that the same thing applies with achieved goals. Partial vs Full Achievement feels valid. So is ""it was on track to achieve but due to a direction of care change is no longer relevant""</p>

While I don't think we need to document the header in order to allow it's use, if we're adding Bundle.entry.links I feel we should document the header pattern. Otherwise there will be a clearly documented place to include this kind of information for each resource in a bundle, but no hint of the appropriate way to handle it for individual resources.</p>

<p>
I feel the documentation for Bundle.entry.link should probably be written in terms of ""provides a place to store the information that for an individual resource is stored in ...."". That would require us to have somewhere where we document the header for individual resources.</p>

That said, you're right that documenting 5884 would cover the pattern. I suppose what I'm talking about is general guidance for future extension, but perhaps the spec is not the appropriate place for that.</p>

My concern with bundles using both the links header and links element is that we have to provide some pretty clear guidance on what should be included in each place.

well, we haev to be clear about this: if you profile the extensions, you're inlined the definition of the type. If you don't show @value, then it's ambiguous whether it's still done or not. So it would require some other approach to make it clear that the only changes to a data type is slicing the extension, and that the rest of the data type information is not displayed (but still found in the actual snapshot). Then this technique can also be applied to complex data types as well as primitives. </p>

Note, though, that this means that the tooling needs to be able to decide correctly whether anything has been constrained. Hard problem.</p>

Well, we can eliminate invariants on nodes that are made 0..0.  However, this invariant should actually be on the base resource (because it applies to elements other than just reasonNotGiven).  The paths as stated won't actually work.  And once the paths are corrected, it would be extremely hard to detect that this particular invariant should be removed because it would require being able to detect that the constraints on the resource would make the xpath impossible to be true.  We *might* be able to pull off this detection once the RDF stuff is working, but until then, most we can do is exclude invariants with a base of or below a 0..0 element.</p>

That sounds really great, but one of the features of the system right now is that changing a resource means you know what profiles you just broke.

well, you can search and replace in the XML files. Or you can write a transform on the spreadsheets in XML. I've done both things (the first I do a great deal). Or you can just accept that the spreadsheets are a transient measure anyway, and were never intended to be pushed this far, and we're going to replace them as soon as we can with a real tool - then you can deal with that tools strengths and weaknesses</p>

This request and the previous one sort of hint at the need to be able to define ""default"" profiles that should be inferred whenever a particular type of resource is referenced or possibly even when a particular data type is referenced.  We'd need to figure out how to define such behavior.  We'd also have to define a way to *remove* such defaults in specific circumstances where we didn't want the default constraints imposed.  We'd also have to think about whether such constraints should automatically apply to any undeclared extensions that subsequently get introduced in instances or in downstream profiles.  Lots of thought needed here to come up with a workable solution.</p>

not happy with the way this is expressed, as if the problem and it's solution are about the authors and editors of the standard. The question is, how does this work from an implementer perspective? what would be the right solution from the implementer perspective. And I would think that the answer is they wouldn't want us to automate the generation of a long list of profiles on variants, but a general statement - Any, as profiled by this IG. Suggests that the solution is that you can profile a resource with an IG reference rather than a direct StructureDefinition reference, but this raises a lot of questions. </p>

None of what you describe is restricted or prevented by the specification. None of it described either, mainly because of doubt that we could get consensus on the various workflows. All we defined was a token to use on the wire. we assumed that there would be protocols around this. And there is a security label that can be used to indicate that a break the glass protocol could be useful in this circumstance (REDACTED). I'm not sure what the link to a break the glass operation would be, since I doubt that it would be a simple URL - it's a process to follow.</p>

yes, CLD = ValueSet.define + ValueSet.compose, and we should clarify this somewhere. most likely, the outcome of the VSD review while ballot is open is a VSD mapping in the detailed descriptions, and a short section on the main value set page. We will be able to cover it there</p>

well, we could clean this either by adding a flag to ValueSet.define for what kind of relationship containment in the resource means, or we could just arbitrarily fix it to 'is-a'.

Presumably this would be an option at the same level as event and repeat - in theory you could have all 3.  I don't think CodeableConcept is overkill.  Having translations is reasonable.  It would also allow for a free-text expression of the timing - separate from the text description of the overall dose.</p>
