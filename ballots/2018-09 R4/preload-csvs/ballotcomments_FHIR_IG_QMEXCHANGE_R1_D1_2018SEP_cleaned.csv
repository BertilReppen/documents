1,2018-Sep DEQM,,,,,,,(profiles),,A-S,Enhancement,,,,"IG Page:(profiles),  (profiles):The specification provides guidance on how to implement a scenario where a remote party calculates the measure report based on the information from the EMR.
In order to do so, two operations are added that allow for more optimal retrieval of the resources relevant to a measure from the EMR and/or the EMR to provide relevant information related to a measure to the measure provider.

This as an alternative to using the patient/$everything operations.

Basically this comes down to a mechanisme where based on DataRequirements, a set of related resources are send to/ retrieved by the interested party.
This could also be implemented in a more generic manner:
1 extend search with the search on code in value-sets
2 extend subscription with searches based on DataRequirements.

This would allow the use cases without the need for specific operations and providing mechanisms that can also be used for other purposes.",Clarify use case,Yes,,,Reach out to commenter for additional context and what section is referring to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bas van den Heuvel ,,,bas.van.den.heuvel@philips.com ,,,,,,

Providers and public health will need additional standards and infrastructure to run consistent and comparable quality measures in healthcare. Much of the content is likely to be usable outside the U.S. Realm.,"IG Page:(profiles),  DaVinci Data Exchange For Quality Measures HomePage:This guide presents itself as almost exclusively a model for providing data to aggregators (payers) so that they can then apply healthcare quality measures. We support payers’ needs for greater access to data for quality measurement. It would be preferable to support standards and infrastructure that make consistent data and measure application available in healthcare at the same time. Otherwise it should be made clear that the guide only serves the specific use case of quality measurement at aggregators (payers) and does not address the use of quality measures in healthcare or for public health. 

The aggregator (payer) model portrayed here is also focused on accessing and using numerator and denominator data inside of specific payer populations. There are other needs in the application of broader, multi-payer population measures, and the in the important marrying of guidelines and performance improvement for providers with their related measures.

The guide does not take advantage of the developing capabilities of FHIR-based rules / measure / guideline support services such as CDS Hooks / SMART on FHIR API-connected rules engines for application in healthcare. The ballot also does not support some elements of a more general reporting infrastructure, usable by other reporting use cases, to reduce provider and EHR burden.

- Aggregators may process CQL, but are not required to in order to support the exchange scenarios described in this Guide
- Providers do not need to use CQL to support the exchange scenarios described in this Guide.
","Aggregators and providers should use a common clinical quality language (CQL) so that measures and guidance can be applied to improve local healthcare practice and in anticipation of consistent application in external Aggregators (payers)

Aggregators and providers should both use a common clinical quality language (CQL) that would allow the same measures to be applied in healthcare and at the aggregator. This would also enable the application of the same measures across populations that span multiple Aggregators (payers)","IG Page:General Guidance and Definitions,  General Guidance and Definitions:Neither healthcare organizations nor payers always represent complete patient populations. This guide currently suggests an architecture and will advance standards that focus almost exclusively on providing data to payers without also enabling providers and population health workers to also readily apply measures themselves. 

We appreciate payers’ needs for data but believe that a better approach would be to use payer leverage to advance standards that enable provider and population health access to data and the application of quality measures in and around healthcare as well as providing the data to payers that they need. 

This standard cannot require CQL application in healthcare, but it should not presume an architecture that does not consider other quality measure user needs. CMS is requiring CQL for the electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) reported through their quality reporting programs beginning in 2019. Why should all payers not build on its use as well? 

The CQL standard was developed to support both guideline/rules distribution and quality measure application because of their important inter-relationship. For this to be effective, however, the use of CQL needs to closely integrate with healthcare.

CQL application at aggregators (payers) is important too. Providers work with multiple payers and inconsistent guideline application in the overall ecosystem will impact them significantly. Furthermore, providers need to be able to more easily get local measure reports and have those reports match national consensus measures and guidelines. Currently, locally applied measures usually do not exactly match national measures. The application of a common language like CQL in healthcare and at aggregators (payers) is needed.

In this optional step, the provider queries the aggregator for which resources/profiles are needed for reporting a given measure. To support the Submit Data operation, an implementation needs to know what data to provide as the payload for the operation. This can be done manually by reviewing the measure definition to determine what data needs to be submitted, or it can be automated using the Data Requirements operation. These profiles are subsequently referenced in the MeasureReport.evaluatedResources element when submitting the measure data to the Aggregator.
","Gather Data Requirements
In this step, the provider queries a common knowledge store for profiles needed for reporting a given measure and how the sending of those data should be initiated. Common data profiles have been developed through a multi-stakeholder consensus-based development process and will be made available from the common site. To support the Submit Data operation, an implementation needs to know specifically what data are required to provide as the payload for the operation.

","IG Page:Profiles defined as part of this Guide,  General Guidance and Definitions:There are several critical points with broad implications expressed in this new language. 

First, quality measures demand very specific data in a consistent form. Running quality measures directly on FHIR resources, as seems to be at least a partial possibility, with the resources default optionality, will not support payer or other needs. We suggest that the guide should insist on use of common profiling to reduce optionality (such as the DEQM, QI-CORE, HEDIS, US Core) and that the profiled data should be accessible to measure application in healthcare as well as at the payer. Profiles are needed to constrain and require data to meet the specific needs of the measures and to align the required data with other efforts. 

Second, the determination of the profiled data necessary for measure application should be performed by a multi-stakeholder consensus-based standards development process either through a national quality-related organization or a consensus-based standards development organization. This guide seems to suggest that the determination of data could vary between payers or could be at the sole discretion of individual payers to determine.

Third, the gathering of data requirements step should be required, and not optional, to insist that the specific data requirements and their profiling are consistently received and implemented. 

Fourth, a higher-level standards construct such as PlanDefinition should be employed to specify parameters for when and how, not just what, data will be reported from EHRs for quality measure and guideline implementation.",Data Requirements,Yes,Fit for teleconference,,"ON behalf of both:John Loonsk, Maria Michaels.

Defined profiles are needed that further constrain data to meet the specific needs of the measures. Even with well-specified data, quality measures run on a payer-specific population will not always be complete, just as localized, healthcare-applied measures will not always be complete. We believe that common profiled data and common measure language are needed at both providers and payers. 

A higher-level standards construct such as PlanDefinition should also be employed to specify parameters for when and how, not just what, data will be reported from EHRs for quality measure and guideline implementation.
