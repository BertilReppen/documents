A number of objects don’t : http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/relatedperson.html, https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-definitions.html#Patient.contact    Both of these concepts don’t really represent what MU3 needs to support proxy relationships.This is probably my biggest comment – can we cover?
1)	What is an active proxy
2)	Can we code a “MU 3 Proxy” type
3)	Proxy type (Parent->Child, Child->Parent, etc.. )

It would be helpful to show a parent organization or show a division name. Today KP is responding with Kaiser Permanente as an organization.
When in fact it is from KP Northwest.
So when we intermix records we have not provenance!
We should make a “division” field and make it non-optional if there is a “parent” org  
Today you need to define a nested hierarchy - “part-of”  Example: Burgers University Medical Center

201,FHIR Core,,,,,,AdverseEvent,,,NEG,Correction,,,,"AdverseEvent.resultingCondition - inadequate and inappropriate for documenting adverse reactions associated with AdverseEvent incidents
Rationale - in very many cases an AdverseEvent incident is associated with a set of adverse reactions similar to the case of Allergy/Intolerance incidents.
Example use case - a patient with severe gingival recession requires tissue graph treatment to cover exposure root of tooth. Soft tissue graft is harvested from patient's oral cavity and attached to the graft site by sutures. A couple of days later, the patient developed intraoral itchness and swelling
The clinician needs to document the findings as adverse reactions
Eventually, the graft devitalised and failed. After further investigation, it was determined that the patient might have suffered from allergic reactions to the suture material
As there is no prior history, this will be recorded and reported eventually as an AdverseEvent incidence with associating allergic adverse reactions
Comment - very often, a resultingCondition cannot be determined at the time of assessing and documenting reactions. What can be known is a temporal relationship between the Event incidence and a set of reactions
This and many other similar use cases support the need for replacing AdverseEvent.resultingCondtion with a Choice for resultingCondition and an AdverseEvent.reaction element that references a new resource: AdverseReaction.

215,FHIR Core,,,,,,Immunization,,,NEG,Clarification,,Description/definition (Scope and Usage section) = The Immunization resource is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines to patients across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions,,"Administration of vaccine (or a record of), which according to the scope and usage description, is not dlinically and semantically equivalent of immunsiation.
Immunisation refers to becoming immune to certain disease(s) against which the person has been vaccinated (received vaccine administration)
It is well established clinically that seroconversion and seroprotection rates after vaccinations vary between different populations (e.g. the young vs the elderly) and for different types of vaccines
This resource (and other related) should be renamed to ""vaccination""",Vaccine administration is not the same as immunization,,,,Not related,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen Chu ,Patient Care WG ,,chuscmi88@gmail.com ,,,,,,

Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should be considered to be potent

Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent","Suggest change definition/description to:
""Indicate a subpotent vaccine was administered. A vaccine dose given may be discovered after the fact as subpotent due to cold chain breach or product recall""","The description/definition for these two elements leads reader to interprete that a subpotent vaccine might have knowingly been administered
It is assumed that these two elements are use in retrsopective documentation when scenarios such as discovery of cold chain breach or product recall due to subpotent batch was known

217,FHIR Core,,,,,,Immunization,,,NEG,Enhancement,,,,"Missing Immunization.doseNumber
doseNumber is included in ImmunizationEvaluation resource but not in Immunization resource
This is an important requirement as the vaccination record should contain information about dose number administered (e.g. dose 2 of 3 of hepatitis B vaccine)
If this information is not included in Immunization resource, how can ImmunizationEvaluation know whether the vaccination schedule is complete?",Missing Immunization.doseNumber,,,,,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen Chu ,Patient Care WG ,,chuscmi88@gmail.com ,,,,,,

Indicates the patient status with respect to the path to immunity for the target disease

ImmunizationRecommendation.recommendation.forecastReason:
The reason for the assigned forecast status","Suggestion:
(1) Create a new ""statusEvaluation"" cluster or backbone element for these two data elements
(2) Rename them to: evaluatedStatus and evaluatedStatusReason
(3) change definition to: indicate assessed status of patient's vaccination, e.g. due, overdue, complete","Element names and definition/description names are extremely confusing. If readers do not navigate to the value set example codes (due, overdue, immune, contraindicated, complete), the reader is completely at lost regarding what these elements are and their intended use

Suggestion:
(1) Given the value set, these two elements do not below to the Recommendation cluster/backbone element. They should form a separate cluster - ""statusEvaluation""
(2) The element names and definition need to be improved",forcast elements are confusing,,,,Not related,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen Chu ,Patient Care WG ,,chuscmi88@gmail.com ,,,,,,
220,FHIR Core,,,,,,ServiceRequest,,,NEG,Clarification,,"ServiceRequest.status
ServiceRequest.intent","ServiceRequest.lifecycleStatus = the state of the service request throug its lifecycle

ServiceRequest.workflowStatus = the progression of the service request through the business/clinical workflow","These two elements represent status of a request lifecylce and status of a request workflow
Suggest that they are changed to reflect what these two elements are actually use to provide clarity and a best-practice pattern for other resources to follow

Suggested changes:
(1) ServiceRequest.status -> ServiceRequest.requestLifeCycleStatus (or simpler: .lifeCycleStatus) with the following values:
active | suspended | completed | entered-in-error | cancelled
(2) ServiceRequest.intent -> .workflowStatus, with the following values:
proposal | plan | draft | order | under review",Rename status and intent,,,,"Not related

Lloyd: Intent is not a status.  It is an immutable characteristic of the resource instance.  Naming is consistent across all resources.  Naming convention is to keep things short.",,Orders & Observations,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stephen Chu ,Patient Care WG ,,chuscmi88@gmail.com ,,,,,,
