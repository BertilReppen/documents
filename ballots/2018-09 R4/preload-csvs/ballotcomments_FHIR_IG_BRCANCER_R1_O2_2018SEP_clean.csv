The concept describes an Her2-Status, equivalent to HER2ReceptorStatus (for which equivocal should be added).

The model uses a Value set, which describes the interpretation of the measured (or estimated) values. Due to the current instability of the interpretation threshold it would be wise to add the ki-67 index (percentage of positive cells) to the model. Furthermore this concept should be grouped with the cultigen-expression tests  and the „classical biomarkers“ to the PathologicalPrognosticStageModel, which has not yet been defined (see my comment #3)",expand the Ki-67NuclearAntigenModel by the measurement value of Ki-67 Index.,,,,,,CIMI,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gunter Haroske ,,,haroske@icloud.com ,,,,,,
