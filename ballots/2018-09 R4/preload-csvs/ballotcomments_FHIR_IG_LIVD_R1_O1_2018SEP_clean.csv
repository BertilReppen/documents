[LOINC] – appears to be optional, and that makes since, but the description under “One vendor IVD Test Result to many LOINCs” claims the structure supports multiple LOINC.  Should it be {[LOINC]}, or is this supported another way.  If so, how?
Recommend adding the following clarifying statement at the end of the section:  Alternately stated: Within the structure above, “IVD Test Result” codes are unique per “Equipment” group, but can repeat across “Equipment” groups.   “LOINC” is not unique, and may repeat when a single LOINC can be mapped to more than one “IVD Test Result”.",Add clarifying statement about uniquness and repeats for IVD Test Codes and LOINC.,Yes,,,,,Orders & Observations,,,,,,,,,,,,,David Burgess ,LabCorp ,,burgesd@labcorp.com ,,,,,,

Add in background example of workflow for a lab professional using the LIVD LOINCS?
Proposed (from Andrea's email):
1.  lab professional or (IT team) builds test order and result(s) and result values allowed for qualitative testing or units for quantitative test results values in their LIS.
2.  They configure their analyzer on which assays/analytes are needed for said orders and results.  In the US, I'd expect most quantitative results values to be reported in mass/volume, while the same assay in other countries is moles/volume.  One of the other would be configured, but not both.  I have seen laboratories configure a qualitative assay for an analyte and also a quantitative assay for the same analyte on the same analyzer depending on which order and results each go with.
3.  Even in current LAW and ASTM interfaces, I haven't seen LOINC and SCT from the analyzer in production.  Believe Biomerieux might be sending some codes with some of their results that are not challenge results (more microbiology).  Don't know how the middleware and LIS are handling said codes as almost all LISs provide LOINC maps in their test set up/dictionary mappings.  Assuming result values with units and analytes are coming across interface into LIS.
4.  Laboratory professional performs mappings in their dictionaries where orders and results have been built. They are referencing vendor and reference lab maps to choose the LOINC for results currently and mapping themselves.  Per the concern about transcription.  All EHRs and LISs certified to 2015 ONC vendor requirements have LOINC and SCT functionality.  Most vendors have functionality to load these standardized terminologies including the FSN or LOINC name into their systems.  Mapping may entail typing in or selecting from a drop down the LOINC code mapped.  When the vendor creates outbound messages it attaches the FSN or LOINC name in the message as it populates other data.  
5.  When LIVD enters the workflow, I expect that an LIS vendor implementation client could have an app that queries the vendor FHIR server for all the LIVD LOINCs to present them to the lab professional to sort/choose from for mapping.",Add in background example of workflow for a lab professional using the LIVD LOINCs.,,,,,,Orders & Observations,,,,,,,,,,,,,Riki Merrick ,"Vernetzt, LLC / APHL ",,rikimerrick@gmail.com ,,,,,,
