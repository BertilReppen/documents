1,Structured Data Capture (SDC),,1.1,,,,,index,http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/2018Sep/index.html,A-S,Enhancement,,(proposed change is to add one bullet to existing list),Some of the data in this form may exists in the patient's record. How can I save the time (and prevent the transcription errors) associated with locating this data and re-entering it into a form?,"The similar bullet above (""Most of the data … exists …"") is really the same as the proposed bullet but the motivation to use this function (SDC) is very different.  
  In the existing  question there is an assumption of ""success"": the data is mosty present inthe patient record and there will be a significant saving in the provider's time. 
  In the proposed bullet the assumption is that there will be a labor intensive search for something to fill in the form, probably ending in few ""hits"" and a drain on the provider's time.

A list of questions that describe the function, benefits and possible shortcomings of the Structured Data Capture (SDC) function are listed.  They seem to be mostly supportive of the development, acquisiton, and use of SDC software.  Another point of view is the possibilty that it SDC will not deliver much useful information, requiring the provider to perform labor intensive chores because the requirement  to supply data was seen as ""free"" because SDC would provide for the requirement.  The intent of this comment is not be negative on the development, acquisiton, and use of SDC; rather, instead, note that it is possibly not the ""miracle drug"" that is seems to be and we should be realistic in our expectatons of its success.

I assume this because of the long line of red ""S"" symbols down the differential table. Would be good to assert this in description. Also, is it really necessary to support *every* element? Some elements, such as ""experimental"", ""code"", ""lastReviewDate"" provide less value to a system that is storing the question to be displayed in a form...

7,Structured Data Capture (SDC),,Structured Data Capture Code System,,,,,(profiles),http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/2018Sep/sdc-codesystem.html,NEG,Clarification,,,,"What is the purpose in profiling the CodeSystem resource? In a questionnaire environment, I wouldn't think CodeSystem would be a primary concern. It is more likely that the Questionnaire will be bound to a ValueSet. That ValueSet may make use of a CodeSystem, but to implementers they are going to be looking to terminology servers to provide the expansion to the valueset to display on the screen, rather than builing the expansion themselves based on a CodeSystem. Questionnaire doesn't appear to directly reference CodeSystem, either. So, I'm just not sure what the purpose of the CodeSystem profile is, or how, why and when it should be used.",What is the purpose in profiling the CodeSystem resource?,Yes,Ready-For-Vote,,,,FHIR Infrastructure,,"Questionnaire is bound to ValueSet, but ValueSet needs to point to Questionnaire - and the code systems will often be specific for the Questionnoare or a set of Questionnaires.

14,Structured Data Capture (SDC),,9 Form extraction,,,,Questionnaire,(profiles),http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html,A-S,Enhancement,,"Questionnaires are excellent tools for data capture. They allow tight control over what data is gathered and ensure information is gathered consistently across multiple users. However, data gathered using different questionnaires - or even different versions of the same questionnaire - is often not comparible. It is also not very searchable or easily integrated with discrete data sources. Because of this, the general recommendation in FHIR is to use questionnaires for raw data capture but then to convert the resulting QuestionnaireResponse instances into other FHIR resources - Observations, MedicationStatements, FamilyMemberHistories, etc. This allows the data gathered to then be easily combined with other data into FHIR documents and messages and exposed over FHIR REST interfaces.",,"This is an excellent framing of Questionnaire vs other types of resource usage and it would be great to have this integrated back into the Questionnaire ""Boundaries and Relationships"" text which contains similar but less clear framing.
