1,Potential Drug-Drug Interaction (PDDI),,4.0.0,NA,,,,,http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pddi/2018Sep/start.html#-400--level-1-implementation,NEG,Correction,,"A CDS Hooks Card extension so that a DetectedIssue resource can be included in a Card response
",,"Looking over the IG, it seems that DetectedIssue is at a level too high for CDS Hooks.  However, I hesitate to make a comment, as the overall workflow on positive DDI dectection would yield a hard-stop for the EHR.  I.e., no record would ever be entered for the Patient.  My hesitation is that it doesn’t really belong in Card.suggestion.action, as those are focused on creating, updating or deleting resources, but it also doesn’t belong on Card.suggestion as it has no context whatsoever.

Which is actually a bigger issue with CDS Hooks—there is no standard placeholder for adding rationale for the Card.indicator.",DetectedIssue in CDS service response,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Phillip Warner ,University of Utah ,,"phillip.warner@utah.edu				 ",,,,,,
