You are asking for input on the two options,,"I don't have an answer as to which option is better, but I can provide input on the requirements for what vital-sign related information is needed to make a decision about whether or not information provided would constitute a 'reportable case'.  This is particularly relevant if the case report specification is also driving the summary of information required for decision support as is currently the situation with the eICR.  This analysis helps understand the scope of VS info needed, although more info could be requested in the case report but not necessarily needed to determine if a case is reportable. 

According to an analysis of the 68 conditions that are nationally notifible, Fever (with a temperature greater that ###) is included in the logic for 14 conditions, including default logic for Brucellosis, Dengue, Influenza, Leptospirosis, Q Fever, Rubella, SARS/MERS, Smallpox, Trichinellosis/Trichiniosis, Typhoid Fever, and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, and optional logic for Coccidioidomycosis, Hantavirus, and Zika virus infection. 

In addition, for Typhoid Fever, there is a criteria of ‘low heart rate (<60)’. 

also, there is a need to represent pulse CO-oximetry levels which we understand may be represented in vital signs.  it is not lab work.  

Do either of the options described in the current draft of the specification impact the ability to give guidance for the implementers to help them identify which vital signs should be included. For example, should the interface pull in the latest vital signs, or the highest temperature in the past ## hours. This issue is particularly important when the there is a lengthy inpatient hospital stay.

I think it makes sense for all encounters. please clarify

Is this saying, if the trigger occurs at 4 hours after admission(or anytime less than 6 hours), it will wait for 2 hours, but if the trigger occurs more than 6 hours after admission, then it will create the eICR at the time of the trigger?   Without data to actually justify it, that timing feels logical.  

It would be useful to have this information to make a decision using data: 
- what is the timing of triggering events relative to admission?
- What is the difference in completeness and quality of informaiton in an eICR when it is created 3, 6, 9, 12 hours after admission in response to a triggered event during that time","input related to: ""Additional timing-related reporting parameters and suggested values""",,,,,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Greg Staudenmaier  ,US Department of Veterans Affairs ,Catherine Staes ,catherine.staes@hsc.utah.edu ,,,,,,

also, i am assuming this would only be relevant when the encournter is inpatient or Emergency dept, but that is not clear from the description.  

also, Is there a standard in FHIR for defining an episode of care? It would be great to include that definition, as it can mean different things in different context: an 'episode of care' for pregnancy can be 8 months long which is not the intent. another 'episode of care' could involve a series of outpatient encounters for a particular procedure.
