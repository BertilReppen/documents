2,US Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO),,0.0.1 Profiles,,,,,(profiles),http://hl7.org/fhir/us/patient-reported-outcomes/2018Sep/profiles.html,A-S,Enhancement,,,,Expand the exampes to include more that are relevant to the use cases of PRO/PROM.  The examples are more relevant to questionnaires than PRO/PROM.  I saw only 1 example that was representative of a PRO/PROM – assessing functional status by selecting option 2.  All the others are examples of questionnaires such as for a patient completing a previsit questionnaire for current medication and past medical and family history.  There should be more examples where there is a “controlled/predefined” list of response options for each question so that responses can be quantified.  ,Expand the exampes to include more that are relevant to the use cases of PRO/PROM,,SDC,,,,FHIR Infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kanwarpreet Sethi ,Lantana Consulting Group ,Robin Williams ,robin.williams@lantanagroup.com ,,,,,,
