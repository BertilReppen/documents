57,FHIR Core,,Value set uri,,,,ValueSet,,,NEG,Clarification,,,,"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/datatypes.html#canonical defines ""canonical"" as ""A URI that refers to a canonical URI.""
This is prima facie confusing. Does this mean that the subject URI a) _is_ a canonical URI, b) that it _contains_ one, c) that it _is-contained_ by one, d) that it refers to some resource from which the canonical URI can be derived, e) or something else?
The XML representation of canonical--""xs:anyURI""--doesn't help clarify the issue.

""Note that the type canonical is not used for the actual canonical URls that are the target of these references, but for the URLs that refer to them, and may have the version suffix in them.""
This seems to rule out (a), but it leaves 'refer' unclear.

""Canonical URLs may also have #fragment references""
Any URI may have a #fragment reference. Does this constrain non-canonical URLs from doing so?

http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/references.html#canonical :
""Many resource types have a defined element ""url"" which is the canonical URI that always identifies the resource. The canonical is the preferred way to reference a conformance or knowledge resource.""
This seems clear enough, though the use of ""canonical"" as a noun is a little disorienting, and it might be better to specify ""resource instance."" 
However, each of the resources identified here as using 'canonical' has a property ""uri"" of type ""url"" with text asserting it's 'canonical.' I.e., the 'canonical' type is not used; rather, the set of expected behavior may be asserted in text.

http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/references.html#canonical
""References to canonical URLs may include a version""
Both URI and Canonical have the same xml definition. Does this imply that non-canonical uris may not include a version? 

I believe the source of confusion for me is that the canonical identifier is documented as a type but it's really a property. 
1. Rename the property from ""uri"" to ""canonicalUri"" to avoid confusion with the commonly understood term ""uri."" The datatype seems redundant, and it could be discarded (though it's used in ElementDefinition).
2. Clarify the relationship. 
Description of property: change from ""Canonical identifier for this value set, represented as a URI (globally unique)"" to ""Globally unique URI for this value set""
Definitions: change from ""This URL can be the target of a canonical reference."" to ""This URL can be the target of a canonicalUri reference in a resource.""
http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/datatypes.html#canonical: idealy, remove the type, but if we must, 
	""A URI used as a canonicalUri."" Add any actual distinctions in the type, if they exist.
http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/references.html#canonical: looks OK, given above changes. Change element name ""url"" to ""canonicalUri.""

Value sets defined in other syntaxes that are available from external publishers defined with a non-SNOMED type syntax that has not been explicitly added to FHIR cannot be represented in ValueSet.compose.   We do not see any way that such a value set can be ""brought in"" by reference using compose.include.valueset either.  FHIR does meet the need for the HL7 product families and for SNOMED.  Outside of that, it is unclear.

For example, using a syntax that either crosses multiple code systems, uses properties/operations not defined by the code system (such as  Child-Of within ICD) and/or includes another value set composed of codes from multiple codesystems as the target (Rob M will use the TQL ICD Child-Of example in his tracker item).
