ODH is primarily designed to facilitate clinical care, including population health; ODH also can be used to support public health reporting, population health, and similar value-based care. ODH is not designed to support billing activities.""",,This IG does not contain any guidance on how to use the artifacts in the IG to meet the stated objectives.  For example there is a composition artifact defined.  Should that be transacted as a FHIR document or using a FHIR RESTful approach.  Could I create a panel and use that instead ?   Without this guidance or at a few use cases to walk through I think the IG is incomplete.,add guidance on how to use the IG artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eric Haas ,Health eData Inc ,,emhaas@healthedatainc.com ,,,,,,

the first sentence of the definition is very confusing and dense.  What is meant by 'current and historical data…'?  Should it be 'current or historical data....'?

I think the word 'data' is  not helpful.  can you use the word 'status' in the definition if it is in the title?

this seems like an odd example to use as you still wouldn't expect the secretary to be at the construction site.  I think the point is more valid if you pick an industry where the person would have an exposure at their work that is not expected for their occupation.  therefore, i would suggest changing the industry to an enterprise such as a power plant or an indoor firing range or boat construction, or a mine operation to illustrate the point.
