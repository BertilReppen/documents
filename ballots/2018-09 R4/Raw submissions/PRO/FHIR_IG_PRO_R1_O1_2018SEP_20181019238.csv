Revisiting the bolded statement is requested: “The Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) will focus on capturing and exchanging patient reported outcome data electronically using the FHIR standard. The data that is captured will be made available to both providers and authorized researchers.” Would “and authorized parties” be more acceptable?"
