	<h2>FHIR STU3 (Pre-Ballot) TestScript - Execution Details</h2>
	<h3>Conventions Used</h3>
	<p>
		The execution of the TestScript resources contained in this folder are constrained by the following
		conventions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Fixtures</b> - All resource reference values can be either url paths or local file system
			paths. The convention for these TestScript resources use local file system paths where the
			execution engine is expected to resolve this path based on the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Leading '/' character - this is resolved as an absolute path based on a known root path
				</li>
				<li>
					No leading '/' character - this is resolved as a relative path based on the location of the
					TestScript resource file
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The TestScript resource in this folder represents initial examples of an Encounter resource create via a
		transaction operation where the Patient and Organization references are defined using conditional parameters.
